##User generated content##

In a e-commerce scenario we want to provide the flexibility for the users of our application to be able to upload custom content and have the application handle it in a way which will not significantly increase hosting costs or cause any end user performance degradation.

In this section we will explore ways in which we can upload and store images and have this content provided through an external source in the form of Azure blob storage. We will capture thumbnails and generate image metadata using Microsoft's Computer Vision APIs and cover ways in which to manage updated user content. Additionally, we will explore integration with the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) for providing scalibility when serving content from our application.

For the purpose of demonstrating these scenarios, we will be extending the admin section of Parts Unlimited, in order to enable admins to create and modify product images used throughout the application.

###Setup###

**TODO-SB** - Flesh out setup as we implement part unlimited modifications
1. Link guide to setting up blog storage in Azure
	* Call out config relevant to implementation
2. Reference Parts Unlimited's DocDB product sample implementation section
3. Link to CDN getting started guide for Azure setup
	* Call out config relevant to implementation

###Creating and storing content###

####Storing content in Azure Storage alongside DocDB####

	1. Correct way of storing images alongside DocDB outside of our application
		* Stored in Azure blob storage
		* URL to image stored in MediaLink by DocDB as opposed to DocDB attachments
			* Enables simplified integration with Queues and WebJobs for out-of-process image manipulation
			* Enables simplified integration with CDN
		* (Reference to DocDB implementation of products for Parts Unlimited)
		* (Call out quick start guide to setting up Azure blob storage)
	
####Manipulating images and extracting metadata####	

	2. Manipulating images and extracting metadata
		* Microsoft's Computer Vision APIs (Project Oxford)
			1. Extract and store image meta data in DocDB for searching
				* Image catogorical description eg Vehicle, Truck
				* Dominant image foreground/background colours - tie into DocDB colour search
			2. Creation of Thumbnail and full image display 
				* Optimised for web (CDN/Blob charged by MB, keeping costs down)
				* "Smart cropping" to maintain focus on image subject matter

####Integrating Azure blob storage with Azure CDN####		
	
	3. Remove content serving responsibility from our application and onto the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)
		* Improve performance and user experience for end users located farther from content source
		* Removing potential high load from, and improving scalability of our application web server, in particular when multiple HTTP requests are required to serve content heavy pages
		
###Updating stored content###
	
####Cache busting####	
	1. Cache busting with deployments - version number query string
	
	2. Cache busting with user updated content.
	
###Additional considerations for managing user generated content###
		
	1. (Image manipulation - Call out: Recommend processing of images out-of-phase/off line with queue / Web Jobs)
	
	2. (CDN - Call out: load, regionalised sites, Traffic manager (Content and site))	

###Parts Unlimited updates###

Extend Part's Unlimited's admin product section
	1. Remove existing product image URL reference field
	2. Replace with file upload field
	3. Leverage Microsoft's Computer Vision APIs to generate:
		* "Smart cropped" thumbnail
		* Resized, web optimised version of source file for larger display
		* Extract image metadata
	4. Remove locally served content and Integrate with Azure blob storage for image hosting
	5. Store link to images (thumb, resized, etc) in DocDb alongside product with meta data
	6. Wrap CDN across the storage account
	7. Modify image display of Part's Unlimited to link to CDN with query string appending version number
	8. Deployment time, replace image with CDN reference
