##Scaling Redis##

Redis is a technology used to cache items from within your application, this making resource hungry requests less often and improving the read performance.

Azure Redis Cache is based on the open-source Redis cache. It gives you access to a secure, dedicated Redis cache, managed by Microsoft and accessible from any application within Azure. 

This section will see us reviewing common mistakes with connection management, identifying an approach to keeping the items in our cache up to date. We'll also look at what happens when the cache is failing over to a secondary or is offline how we detecting these failure conditions and ensure our application is resilient at failure time.

We will mention Sharding within the premium tier, other types of data retrieval within Redis (Sets, query, sort, pub sub) and Cache providers which can plug into your application with minimal code changes.

###Setup###

Tiers in Azure, what they are for and how they are different.

(Call out to service tiers) Load balancing / HA
		1. basic single node no replication, go down see No resiliancy.
		2. standard : two nodes, dedicated hardware, no throttling up to machine specs, update second tier, in memory replication, automated switching fail over bethe scenes.
		3. premium : sharding, percistance to disk

###Cache options###

Redis is a quick access in memory data store, because of this there are several applications of how Redis can be integrated into your application. Including some which plug into existing ASP.NET extensibility points.

* Output cache - [Azure Redis ASP.Net Output cache provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cache-asp.net-output-cache-provider/)
* Session state - [Azure Redis Session State provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cache-asp.net-session-state-provider/)

The rest of this example will look at using Redis within our application layer to store frequently accessed application data.

###Client Libraries###

There are multiple client libraries across several languages. Each library can be used to connect into Redis servers. Because Parts unlimited is an ASP.NET application this example will use a C# library. The two most common and recommended by Redis.io client libraries for c# are ServiceStack.Redis and StackExchange.Redis.  For this example we have chosen to use StackExchange.Redis. 

See [here](http://redis.io/clients) for an up to date list of client libraries which support Redis.

###Connection###

The first thing which is required is to setup a connection to the Redis cache which has been configured within Azure. The StackExchange.Redis client uses multiplexing through a single connection. The recommended usage is to create a single instance of the client and use this instance for all further commands issued to the cache. See the Parts Unlimited implementation of the connection [here](..\..\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite\Cache\PartsUnlimitedRedisCache.cs) 

    private static Lazy<ConnectionMultiplexer> lazyConnection = new Lazy<ConnectionMultiplexer>(() =>
    {
        return ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(configurationOptions);
    });

    public static ConnectionMultiplexer Connection
    {
        get { return lazyConnection.Value; } 
    }

###Retry / Failure###

As experienced developers we know transient errors occur and if not managed correctly will manifest into a poor experience for users of the application. 
To make our applications as robust and resilient as possible we need to consider patterns to reduce the impact of these transient errors. 

**TODO** : Redis Failover dialog and link - Explain the failure scenario E.g. Redis slave / failover and opportunity for down time while failover in progress.. Only if secondary exists (Tie back to the tiers)

####Minimising impact####

The StackExchange.Redis client has connection management retry logic built in to the libraries. Unfortunately this retry logic is only supported when establishing the initial connection to the cache and does not apply to operations and commands against the cache once the initial connection has been made. The retry logic also does not have a configurable delay between retry attempts, simply it retries connecting after the connection timeout expires for the specified number of retries.

We want to have more control with our retry logic and also be able to apply this logic to more operations than just our initial connection. Because of this we will make use of the [Transient fault handling application block](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn440719.aspx). This application block has built in support for common storage mechanims out of the box (Azure SQL, Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage). 

Unfortunately there is no direct support for Redis Cache in the application however we can customize the behavior to understand whether an error is transient. This is achieved through the use of the ITransientErrorDetectionStrategy.  This interface defines the behavior which must be implemented by custom components responsible for detecting specific transient conditions.

    public interface ITransientErrorDetectionStrategy
    { 
        bool IsTransient(Exception ex);
    }

This interface allows a custom transient error detection strategy. This determines whether the specified exception  which occurs represents a transient failure that will be compensated by a retry by the framework.

Our implementation of this interface is [RedisTransientErrorDetectionStrategy.cs](..\..\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite\Cache\RedisTransientErrorDetectionStrategy.cs). 

> Notice that we interrogate the internals of the RedisConnectionException to determine if it's a connection error which > should be retried based on the ConnectionFailureType.FailureType, otherwise if it's a timeout we will retry.

To pull the framework and the RedisTransientErrorDetectionStrategy together see the [TransientRedisCacheWrapper](..\..\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite\Cache\TransientRedisCacheWrapper.cs).

    var fixedRetryStrategy = new FixedInterval(3, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
    _retryPolicy = new RetryPolicy<RedisTransientErrorDetectionStrategy>(fixedRetryStrategy);

This is where we identify the retry strategy (FixedInterval) with the custom error detection strategy (RedisTransientErrorDetectionStrategy). Here you can see we have opted for a fixed interval retry strategy.

> There are other retry strategies which are available through the framework. 
> Alternatively you can use 'ExponentialBackoff' or 'Incremental'.

####Failure alternatives####

Source, 
Other cache in background

If it's a non transient failure OR a repeated failure then perhaps we need to dermine whether we want to go to the underlying data source or point the user to an error page. Depends on application and context of the error.

1. Route to another Cache and Lazy load

### Code ###
Wrap behind interface with generic signatures to swap out the cache with another one depending on somthing.
Code to the interface not the concrete example, see startup.config switching out interface to mem cache if no connection string defined.

## Fallback to original source ###

1. Connection management done right.
1. Failover / Monitoring, 
	1. (Call out to Azure diagnostic logs / alerts) - EvictedKey a metric to look at. 
	2. (Call out to service tiers) Load balancing / HA
		1. basic single node no replication, go down see No resiliancy.
		2. standard : two nodes, dedicated hardware, no throttling up to machine specs, update second tier, in memory replication, automated switching fail over bethe scenes.
		3. premium : sharding, percistance to disk
	3. During fail over what happens to your application as it's switching to secondary **(Decision as to Call out VS build)** ***TODO : Determine what is cached as this will mean we need to have items in the cache which need to be written to when an error occurs***
		1. Route to another Cache and Lazy load
		1. Route to underlying store, in Parts Unlimited potential to pass all queries off to source, if this is SQL call out potential to create bottle neck at the database.
			1. Read only data - re-direct to error page 
			2. Write data - in the case of parts unlimited becuase this means income write orders to the source database
	3. Fail over monitored with Transient fault handling with custom detection strategy
2.  Cache invalidation / refresh
	1.  Pre loading of the cache.
	2.  Worker task to keep cache items up to date,  
	2.  (Timed job to refresh cache items from source with a window less that the cache expiry)
2. Cached objects
		1.  Azure Redis ASP.Net Output cache provider 
		2.  Azure Redis Session State provider
		3.  Cache in your Business layer cache
	2.  Cache options
	3.  Can be a KVP, lesser known features sets, sorting and pub sub abilities. Call out to Signal R Back plane ?

###Parts Unlimited updates###

Update Parts unlimited to cache the order history, shows use of sets and ordering. 
TODO : Need to determine the fail over scenario if this is to be shown. Perhaps add customer balances updated at order time ? - E.g. Important for admin to carry out billing, that will go back to database but cached items will not.
