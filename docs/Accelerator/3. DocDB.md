##DocDB; Storage and indexing of Arbitrary Data Structures##

Microsoft Azure DocumentDB is the highly-scalable NoSQL document database-as-a-service that offers rich query and transactions over schema-free data, helps deliver reliable and predictable performance, and enables rapid development.

To highlight the capability of the schema free database we will show an architectural approach to address the schema free and embrace loose typings. This will be shown through storage of the product catalog with products which contain deeply nested attributes and show an approach how they can be shown and queried across.  


###Flow###

1. Complex arbitraty JSON documents
1. Load JSON templates from DB to render
1. Allow users to see, a BoM type structure and to search for similar items deep within that structure
where search relies on indexed arbitrary structure
	1. In particular we need to show the power of being able to perform a fast, strongly typed query, on arbitraty data structures
	2. Call out the indexing options
	2. Something where it matters to be numeric, and it matters to be a string, To show that it's not just Full Text Indexing, and we want to be deeply nested

Re work product storage to utilize DOC DB
Re work product display to store template in doc db.
Template will contain how to load and search for similar products.

Product search, find other products which could apply to this model: Include Manufacturer, model, **year number**, country origin. Search for products with same and year +/- 3 years as they are similar.
