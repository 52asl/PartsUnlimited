### Task 1: Install Docker Client on Your Machine

In this exercise, you will install Docker client on your machine. If you are performing the steps in an Azure virtual machine with Docker already installed you can move to the next exercise.

If you wish to use an Azure virtual machine <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/nested-virtualization-in-azure/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> nested virtualization is supported in Azure</span></a> using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-new-dv3-and-ev3-vm-sizes/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Dv3 and Ev3 virtual machines sizes.</span></a>



This exercise is intended for scenarios where your environment does not already have Docker available in your windows environment.

If you are performing these steps in your local windows environment you do not need a Microsoft Azure subscription for this first exercise, but you will need one for the subsequent exercises.


1. Navigate to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Install Docker</span></a> page and quickly familiarise yourself with what options are available for installing Docker. You can choose an appropriate option for you and your environment, but we will use the Docker Community Edition (CE) and our steps below will be based around Windows, you can install docker and follow the steps in your Linux or macOS environment also if you wish.

2. Navigate to <a href="https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Docker Community Edition download page</span></a>, locate your operating system i.e. **Docker CE For Windows** and click the **Download from Docker Store**  link.

    
3. On the  <a href="https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc"> Docker Commnunity Edition for Windows</span></a>, page, click the **Get Docker CE for Windows (stable)** button, we will use the stable version and follow the prompts to complete the installation. You may need to restart to complete the depending on your installation.


    ![Docker CE for Windows(stable)](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\DockerCEforwindows.png)




4. Once docker is installed, open a **command prompt** and run the below command and verify help command options are returned. 

    **Note:** The commands that we will run through in the following steps, will be the same in Windows, Linux or macOS.

    ```
    docker 
    ```
    ![Docker cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\docker.png)

5. Run the below command and verify it returns version information. It should return the client and server details for version, API version, GO version, Git commit, date built and OS/Architecture

    ```
    docker version 
    ```
    ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerversion.png)

6. Run the below command and verify it returns just the version information

    ```
    docker --version 
    ```

    ![Docker--version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\docker--version.png)

7. Run the below command to get the docker compose version. Docker-compose allows you write .yml files to configure an application’s services in your containers.

    ```
    docker-compose --version 
    ```
    
    ![Docker compose cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercomposever.png)

8. Run the below command  to get the docker machine version. Docker machine allows you to manage host machines

    ```
    docker-machine -- version 
    ```
    
    ![Docker machine cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockermachine-ver.png)


9. Run the below command. This will return various information about number of containers, running, images, architecture, and various settings. Scroll through them to get a feeling for what the individual elements are referring to.

    ```
    docker info
    ```
    ![Docker machine cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerinfo.png)







### Task 2: Run a docker container on Windows

In this exercise, you will run a container to demonstrate the concept of immutability with containers.


1. Verify that docker is correctly installed by running the command below to see what containers are present on the system. If it is a new installatio an dno containers have been run previously, there will  be none listed, as in the screenshot.

    ```
    docker ps -a
    ```
    
    ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpsdasha.png)



2. Start by running a simple windows container with the command prompt, cmd.exe, running in it, by running the following command:

    ```
    docker run -it microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
    ```

    A new command window will open which is running inside the container. The context in which the cmd window is running will indicate it is running inside the container with the command you have just run, as in the screenshot below.

    ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cmdinsidecontainer1.png)

    
    - **Potential Errors and Issues:**
        - If you receive a message saying something like *image operating system "windows" cannot be used on this platform"*, your docker installation may be set to run Linux containers and you need to switch it to windows, to be able to successfully run windows containers. (or vice versa)

        ![Docker version cmd output](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerrunwindowserror.png)

        Do this by going to the system tray, selecting the arrow, locating the **docker** icon, right clicking it and choosing **switch to Linux containers...**

        ![Docker system tray](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerinsystray.png)


        ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\switchtowindowscontainersmenu.png)

        This may take a minute or so to switch, you can verify it is switched by checking that the message in the menu, now prompts to switch to Linux containers i.e. the opposite to what it was

        ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\switchtolinuxcontainers.png)
            
    - If you receive an error message saying something like *..encountered and error during CreateContainer: failure in a Windows system call:....virtual hard disk files must be run uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse......*  this may be due to the disk where the container is trying to run, being compressed or encrypted. You will need to uncompress or unencrypt the disk to allow the container to run on that disk.
     
        ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\encryptionrunerror.png)




3. Inside the command prompt in the newly started container run the following commands in sequence, to view the directory contents, create a directory called **demo**, then go inside of the new **demo** directory


    ```
    dir 
    md demo 
    cd demo 
    ```
        
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmd_mdcddemo.png)


4. Create a new file called **myfile.txt** and add some text, press **Enter** after you type the text, and then exit the *copy con* command and copy the file by running the below commands

    ```
    copy con myfile.txt 
    Hello this is in my docker container 
    ```

    press **Enter** then exit the command by pressing the below keys

    ```
    ctrl+c 
    ```
    
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmd_copycon.png)


5. Verify the newly created file is present by running the command

    ```
    dir
    ```
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmd_dir2.png)



6. Exit the container by running the command

    ```
    ctrl + q
    ```

    If this is not working for you try the command sequence **ctrl + p + q** (holding down the ctrl key while pressing p and then q in sequence.)
    You should retrun to a command prompt and the header in the command prompt window should no longer have the docker command. 

    **Note:** this command exits the container but leaves it running.

7. When back on the host run the following command

    ```
    docker ps
    ```


    Now you should see a container running with a generated name. Note the name for use in later steps. If you have run containers previously and they are still running in your environment they may also be listed, but the below screenshot only has one listed.

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpscmd.png)


8. Verify that you don’t see the file you created earlier, **myfile.txt** on your host by going to the **C:** directory and running the command 

    ```
    dir
    ```

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\OSDisk.png)


9. Stop the container by running the below command 

    ```
    docker stop <name-of-the-container> 
    ```

    or

    ```
    docker stop <container ID> 
    ```

    (the name or contianer ID can be obtained from running the **docker ps** command. 
    
    Also, note that you only need to provide the first two digits of the container ID for the command to run successfully, once it is a unique ID value you do not need to provide the whole ID.)


10. Now run the below commands to view the running containers, and then view all containers, including stopped containers.

    ```
    docker ps 
    docker ps -a 
    ```
    
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpsa.png)


11. Now launch a container with the cmd.exe running as was done earlier, by rnuning the below command again.

    ```
    docker run -it microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
    ```

12. Inside the running container command prompt window container run the command

    ```
    dir
    ```

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercmddir.png)


13. Verify that the folder and file your created earlier, i.e. **myfile.txt** is **not**  present.

This demonstrates the immutability, or unchanging nature, of containers i.e. every time we start a container we get a new fresh copy and the changes that were made to it while it was running previously are not present in this new running instance.

You should exit the docker container by typing **exit** when you are finished. You can also run the commands **docker ps** and **docker ps –a** to view the currently running and all containers that have run.

 
### Task 3: Build a new Container Image

In this exercise, you will go through the steps of creating a new Container image, firstly from the command line using Docker commit, and then using a docker file and the docker build command. You can also view similar related tasks by watching the course demos in Module 1 > Lesson 3 - Containers and Docker. 

#### Create a container image using steps on the command-line

1. In the command line ensure that docker is installed and then run the command 

    ```
    docker run -it --name mycontainername microsoft/windowsservercore cmd
    ```

2. In the running container window run the following commands, to create a folder and .txt file in the container, enter some text into the .txt file, press **Enter** after typing the text, type **ctrl+c** to exit the **copy con** command and then exit the container.

    ```
    md builddemo 
    cd builddemo 
    copy con myfile.txt 
    This is a text file 
    ```

    press **ctrl + C** to exit the *copy con* command, then exit the container by running the command

    ```
    exit
    ```

    **Note:** Windows does not support the committing of a running container to an image so we need to exit, by typing **exit** and not typing **ctrl + p + q** which leaves the container running.

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\cntrcmds1.png)


3. Back in the command line, view the containers by running the command

    ```
    docker ps -a
    ```

    If the container is still running, stop it by using the command

    ```
    docker stop <imagename> 
    ```
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerpsandstop1.png)

4. Create an image for the container you just created by running the command 

    ```
    docker commit <mycontainername> <mycontainerimagename>
    ```
    
    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercommit.png)

5. View the available images by running the command

    ```
    docker images
    ```

    ![Docker right click menu switch to windows containers](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerimages.png)

6. View a list of the containers, remove the earlier container that you commited to an image and verify it has been deleted by running the commands 

    ```
    docker ps –a 
    docker rm <mycontainername> 
    docker ps –a 
    ```

    **Note:** if you have a large number of containers on your system, they can use up a significant amount of space, if you wish to delet them all you can use the `docker system prune` command, more details are available on the docker docs page <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">docker system prune </span></a>


7. Now run a container based on the same container that you ran earlier, in step 1, i.e. using the same container name < mycontainername>, and verify the folder you created earlier is not present in the container, i.e. all changes were not retained in the container, and then exit the container. 

    ```
    docker run -it --name < mycontainername > microsoft/windowsservercore cmd 
    dir 
    exit
    ```

    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockerimagename.png)

8. Now run your newly created container image by running the command 

    ```
    docker run -it < mycontainerimagename> cmd 
    dir
    ```
    
    ![Docker contianer run](../assets/workingwithcontainers-jan2018\dockercontsinerimagefolder.png)

9. Verify the **builddemo** folder you created earlier is present in the image you created. You can open the text file within this folder to verify it is the same file if you wish. 

    This demonstrates that changes made within containers can be retained by committing the container to an image.


#### Create a container image using the docker build file

    Firstly, you will need to create some files that you will need, Dockerfile and index.html.

1. Create the Dockerfile byt creating a folder on your local drive **C:\Dockerfile**

2. In this folder, create a new .txt file and copy or type in the following, in the format below, each in a new line.

    ```script
    FROM microsoft/iis
    WORKDIR /inetpub/wwwroot
    ADD index.html index.html
    ```

3. Save the file with no extension, with the name **Dockerfile**
    - The first line in the file is the base image we will use
    - The second line sets a working directory in the container of /inetpub/wwwroot
    - The third line, then adds a file, index.html, to that directory

4. Still in this folder create a new file called Index.html file, then open the file in notepad and copy or type in the following text. When finished Save the file.

    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>my html page in a container</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    Welcome to my html page in a docker container
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4. You should now have a folder **C:\Dockerfile** containing two files, as below, that contain the above content.
    - Dockerfile
    - Index.html


    Now we will go ahead and build our container image using the newly created files and the docker build command

5. In the command prompt window go to C:\Dockerfile folder by typing

    ```
    cd dockerfile
    ```

6. Build the image by running the following command in the command line from within the folder you created earlier that contains the files i.e. **C:\Dockerfile**

    **Note:** do not forget the ‘ . ‘ at the end of the below command, this specifies the context in which it needs to build the image, which is the folder you are in)

    ```
    Docker build -t <container image name i.e. something like iiscntr1> .
    ```

    The image should be built successfully

3. View the image you just built by running the command

    ```
    Docker images
    ```

4. Now run the image by running the following command

    ```
    Docker run -d -p 80:80 < iiscntr1>
    ```

5. View the running container by running the following command, you may need to open a new command prompt window to do so.

    ```
    Docker ps
    ```

    In addition, note the container ID for use in the next step.

6. Obtain the IP address for the container by running the following command

    ```
    Docker inspect <container ID>
    ```

    Note: You do not need to type the full container ID, you only need to enter the first two or three characters.


7. Scroll through the output and under **Networks** > Locate the **IPAddress** value


8. Open a browser and go to the IP address you noted in the previous step i.e. type  **http://<IPAddresss value>**


9. You should see the new website running on port 80 serving the index.htm file that is in the current folder


10. As an additional step, you could stop the running container and return to the web browser and verify the web page is no longer available.

    Do not delete the image as we will use this in later exercises, However you should stop the container image using the command 

    ```
    docker stop <image name>. 
    ```

    Failure to stop the image may result in some errors in later exercises in this module.


 

### Task 4:  Create a repository with Azure Container Registry and Push a customized container image to it.

In this exercise, you will create an Azure Container Registry, and then push a previously created container image to the Azure Container Registry.

#### Create and connect to an Azure Container Registry

1. In http://portal.azure.com, 

2. Click New and locate Azure Container Registry service and click Create

3. Use the values
    - Registry name: **acr12**
    - Subscription: **<your own subscription>**
    - Resource group: **Create new** > **acr12_rg**
    - Location: **< data center location nearest to you >**
    - Admin User: **enable**
    - Storage Account: **Create new** > **storage account nam**e > **acr12storage**
    And click **Create** when finished entering the above.

4. Open the Container Registries and open your newly created container registry service.

5. Go to Access keys and copy down the following details to use when setting up the
    - Registry name: **acr12**
    - Login server: **< it should look something like this, acr12.azurecr.io >**
    - Username: **acr12**
    - Password: **<it should look something like this, `H/v+8L3X/jlmHa=0Q+=p5xQO/3pH0aj=`>**

6. Verify you can connect from the command line by running the command

    ```
    Docker login –u <user name i.e. acr12> -p < password i.e. something like Vm/G+E+//r/=/=nPP+N0=p=rfcWd6MdL > <Login server i.e. acr12.azurecr.io >
    ```

  You should receive a Login Succeeded message.

#### Push a customized container image to an Azure Container Registry

1. Still logged into you Azure Container Registry service, from the command line run the command
docker images

2. You should see an image that you created earlier, named iiscntr1 or whatever you named it in Exercise 3.

3. Tag your container image and prefix it with the name of your Azure Container registry by running the command

    ```
    docker tag <image name i.e. iiscntr1 > < registry login server i.e. acr12.azurecr.io>/ <image name i.e. iiscntr1>
    ```

    The command should look something like the below

    ```
    docker tag iiscntr1 acr12.azurecr.io/iiscntr1
    ```

    If you do not prefix the image with your container registry name, you will not be able to push it to your container registry.

4. Verify the image has been tagged correctly by running the command, it will have the same hash ID value as the original image, but will just be tagged differently

    ```
    docker images < new image full repository and image name i.e. something like acr12.azurecr.io/iiscntr1>
    ```

    The command should look something like the below

    ```
    docker images acr12.azurecr.io/iiscntr1
    ```

5. Now push the image to your Azure Container Registry by running the command

```
docker push acr12.azurecr.io/iiscntr1
```

6. Open your Azure Container Registry service in the azure portal and go to Repositories, and verify the image is now listed under repositories. Verify it also has the latest tag associated with it.

Do not delete image or the Azure Container registry service, as it will be used in a subsequent exercise.




### Task 5: Using docker-compose to orchestrate multiple containers

In this exercise, you will create multiple container instances that have a dependency. You will create a blog website that has a dependency on a database that also run’s in a container. 

The required files for this practical exercise can be found in the [https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Devops200.4x-ConfigMgmtForContainerizedDelivery/M01/Labs](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Devops200.4x-ConfigMgmtForContainerizedDelivery/M01/Labs)

The download is available on the Home page in the course, under the Course Handouts section. 


As part of the set Docker-compose setup the lab will download a sampe application from codeplex.com The complete video of this exercise can also be found in Module 1 > Lesson 4 > Demo: Docker Compose 


#### Build multiple container environment using docker-compose 

1. Open a command and go to the folder where the mod 1 Labfiles have been downloaded and extracted. i.e. C:\Labfiles\Mod 1 Ex 5 

    It consists if the following folders and files 

    - db
      -  Dockerfile 
      - Setup-blogdatabase.sql 
      - Setup-blogtables.sql
    - web 
      - buildapp.ps1
      - Dockerfile
      - Web.config
    - Docker-compose.yml


2. Open the files, look through them, and try to understand the configuration that they will perform, the various elements within them and how they are inter-related. 

3. Build and then start the container environment by running the following command in the command line in the folder where the files are located. These commands need to be run from within the folder where the files are located. 

    ```
    Docker-compose build 
    Docker-compose up 
    ```
    If you receive errors when running the docker-compose build command, such as 

    ```
    “Service 'web' failed to build: failed to register layer: re-exec error: exit status 1: output: remove ….” 
    ```

    try the following 
    - ensure you have enough space to download and extract the images, 
    - ensure that the IIS image you ran in Exercise 3 has been stopped. 

    You could also download the images separately, **microsoft/aspnet** 

    If you receive an error related to not being able to access the virtual machine when running the `docker-compose up` command, wait for a few minutes and retry the command. 

4. Start a new command prompt to inspect the running containers 

5. Inspect the running containers and find the IP address of the web frontend Docker ps and
Docker inspect <container ID> 

6. Locate the IPAddress in the Network section in the output 

7. Open a web browser to go to the blogsite running in the containers using the web IP address i.e. http://IPAddress/blogengine If you receive and compile error, attempt to access the web site using just the IPAddress, and verify you receive an access denied message, this will just verify
that the site is indeed up. The compile error may be related to an application version on your system.

8. Take down the web and database containers by ensuring you are in the folder where your Dockerfile is located and running the command docker-compose down 9. You can then view the container details by running the commands docker ps and docker ps -a 10. Verify the containers are no longer running.
