<h2><span style="color: #0000CD;">Prerequisites:</span></h2>

1. Completion of Module 2 lab Using Continuous Integration with a Migration-Based Development Process.

<h2><span style="color: #0000CD;">Tasks overview:</span></h2>

In this lab, we will begin releasing our changes to downstream databases.

__1. Prepare your local environment__ - We will set up a local environment for releases.

__2. Implement a Continuous Release process for Integration__ - We will implement an automation release process for continuous integration output.

__3. Implement a Release process for QA__ - We will implement a manual release process for another environment.

### Prepare our local environment

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio** and connect to your instance. Enter this code in a query window and execute it. This will create the empty databases that we will use for our release process.

```
CREATE DATABASE WWI_QA;
GO
CREATE DATABASE WWI_Staging;
GO
```
2. Verify that the databases exist. You should see the WWI_QA and WWI_Staging databases if you refresh the database folder.

![In Object Explorer, in the Databases folder, WWI_QA and WWI_Staging display.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image1.jpg)

3. Expand the **Security** folder, right-click **Logins**, then click **New Login**.

![The Security folder is expanded, the Logins folder is selected, and from its right-click menu, New Login in selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image15.jpg)

4. Configure a new login for your builds with a strong password. This is an account the agent will use, so choose SQL Server Authentication. If your agent runs as a service with a specific account, you can add that here. The name we are using in the lab is **VSTSRelease**. Uncheck **Enforce Password Policy**, then click **OK**.

![In the New Login dialog box, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image16.jpg)

5. On the **User Mapping** page, we will add the login to the databases for integration and QA. We will use the **db_owner** role as the user must be able to control all aspects of the database. 

![The Login Properties page has three panes. In the first pane, under Select a page, User Mappings is selected. In the second pane, in the Users mapped to this login table, the check box for WWI_Integration is selected. In the third pane, under Database role membership for WWI_Integration, the check boxes for db owner and db securityadmin are selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image17.jpg)

Remember this user and password. We will use it in the sections below.

6. Repeat the previous steps for a new login called **VSTSReleaseStaging**, mapping this user to only the **WWI_Staging** database as **db_owner**.

### Implement a Continuous Release process for Integration

1. Open your VSTS account, select the **WideWorldImporters-RR** project, click the **Build&Release** menu at the top and select **Releases**. You should see an empty release definition page.

![On the WideWorldImporters-RR page, the Build&Release menu is selected, and the Releases tab is selected. Under Release, the New definition button is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image2.jpg)

2. Click **New definition** button. You will receive a list of templates to select. We will choose the **Empty** definition, then click **Next**.

![On the Create release definition page, under Select a template, Empty is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image3.jpg)

3. The next page asks which project and build source to use. The default project and your CI definition should be listed. Check the **Continuous Deployment** check box and click the **Create** button.

![On the Create release definition page, under Choose a source that publishes the artifact to be deployed, Build is selected. The Project and the Source (Build definition) fields are set to WideWorldImporters-RR. At the bottom is a check box for Continuous deployment.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image4.jpg)

4. This will create an empty release definition with a default name.

![On the Releases tab, in the left pane, under Release Definitions, All release definitions is selected. On the right, in the Definition*.New Empty Definition pane, under Add environment, Environment 1 is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image5.jpg)

Click the **pencil** icon next to the name to edit it. Enter **Release to Integration** as the name.

![The Definition field now displays Release to Integration.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image12.jpg)

5. Let us start by naming the environments for the database where we will release code. Single-click the name **Environment 1** and change this to **Integration**.

![Environment 1 is now renamed to Integration.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image13.jpg)

6. Click **Run on agent** line in the middle section. This will open properties on the right. Change the deployment queue to **Default** to execute this deployment on your local agent.

Click **Close** to close the Task catalog.

8. The **Redgate** task should be selected with properties to the right. We will configure these items separately in the next few steps.

![In the left  pane, in red text, Run on agent displays. Under this, in red text, Deploy to is selected. In the right, Deploy to pane, fields are empty.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image10.jpg)

9. Click the **ellipsis** next to Package to Deploy. This will allow us to select a package from our build artifacts. Expand the tree to find the .ps1 file in the Database_Package artifact. This should be named for your project with an _DeployPackage at the end. Select it then click **OK**.

![Under Select File Or Folder, the following folders are expanded: Linked Artifacts\WideWorldImporters-RR-CI (Build)\Database_Package. In the Database_Package folder, WideWorldImporters-RR_DeployPackage.ps1 is selected. At the bottom, in the Location field, this same path displays.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image11.jpg)

10. For the Release Version, we will use a system variable. Enter **1.0.$(Release.Releaseid)** in the edit box. The **Release.Releaseid** is a system variable that is incremented during each release.

![In the Deploy to pane, in the Release Version field, the 1.0$(Release.Releaseid) version is entered.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image14.jpg)

11. We will now configure the target database properties. These will vary depending on your particular instance. Replace the values below with those that are appropriate for your instance.

* Target SQL Server Instance: .\SQL2016 - This is the instance name as your agent will connect to it.
* Target Database Name: WWI_Integration - From the first part of this lab above.
* Database Username: $(DeployUser) - A variable we will create.
* Database Password: $(DeployPwd) - A variable we will create.

![In the Deploy to .\SQL2016 pane, fields are populated with the previously defined settings.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image18.jpg)

12. Click the **Variables** menu item in the release definition. In the **Variables** list below, enter two new variables:

* DeployUser: VSTSRelease (created in the first part of this lab)
* DeployPwd: Use the value you entered for this login in the first part of this lab. Click the padlock to the right to hide the actual value as a secret.

![On the Definition*.Release to Integration page, on the Variables tab, two variables display: DeployUser (with Value VSTSRelease), and DeployPWD (with the value obscured).](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image19.jpg)

13. Click the **Triggers** menu item. **Continuous Deployment** should be selected. This will trigger a release when the CI build completes.

![Under Triggers, the Continuous Deployment check box is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image20.jpg)

14. Click **Save** to save the release. Enter a **comment **for the version control of this definition, then click **OK**.

![Under Save, in the Comment field, Initial release definition displays.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image21.jpg)

15. Test the release by returning to Visual Studio. Right-click the **Migrations** folder, click **Add**, then click **Script**. Enter this code in the migration script.

```
CREATE TABLE Sales.Regions
( RegionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED
, RegionName VARCHAR(200)
);

```

Click **Save**, then click **Deploy the Project**.

![A pop-up displays saying that the Script Status is Deployed.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image22.jpg)

16. Go to **Team Explorer** and the **Changes** tab. Your new migration script should be listed. Enter a **comment**, then click **Commit All and Push**.

![On the Changes tab, the Commit All drop-down menu displays, and the option to Commit All and Push is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image23.jpg)

17. Open your VSTS project and quickly navigate to the **Build** definitions. You should find a build which might be in the **Not Started** or **In Progress** states. In the image below, build 5 has not been started.

![On the Changes tab, the Commit All drop-down menu displays, and the option to Commit All and Push is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image23.jpg)

18. Quickly move to the **Releases** page, as this should start as soon as the build completes. You should be able to find a release in progress if you click the refresh button.

![Under Release to Integration / Edit, the Releases tab is selected. Under Release, Release-1 is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image25.jpg)

19. Refresh the page until the build is complete. When it is complete, the rectangle next to the release number should turn green. Click the **ellipsis** to the left and click **Open**.

![Under Release to Integration / Edit, the Releases tab is selected. Under Release, Release-1 is selected. The ellipsis button is clicked, and from its drop-down menu, Open is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image26.jpg)

20. The **Summary** tab opens and includes some basic details.

9. Click the **ellipsis** next to Package to Deploy. This will allow us to select a package from our build artifacts. Expand the tree to find the .ps1 file in the Database_Package artifact. This should be named for your project with an _DeployPackage at the end. Select it, then click **OK**.

![Under Select File Or Folder, the following folders are expanded: Linked Artifacts\WideWorldImporters-RR-CI (Build)\Database_Package. In the Database_Package folder, WideWorldImporters-RR_DeployPackage.ps1 is selected. At the bottom, in the Location field, this same path displays.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image11.jpg)

10. For the **Release Version**, we will use a system variable. Enter **1.0.$(Release.Releaseid)** in the edit box. The **Release.Releaseid** is a system variable that is incremented during each release.

![In the Deploy to pane, in the Release Version field, the 1.0$(Release.Releaseid) version is entered.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image14.jpg)

11. We will now configure the target database properties. These will vary depending on your particular instance. Replace the values below with those that are appropriate for your instance.

* Target SQL Server Instance: .\SQL2016 - This is the instance name as your agent will connect to it.
* Target Database Name: WWI_QA - From the first part of this lab above.
* Database Username: $(DeployUser) - A variable we will create.
* Database Password: $(DeployPwd) - A variable we will create.

![In the Deploy to .\SQL2016 pane, fields are populated with the previously defined settings.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image30.jpg)

12. Click the **Variables** menu item in the release definition. In the **Variables** list below, enter two new variables:

* DepoyUser: VSTSRelease (created in the first part of this lab)
* DepoyPwd: Use the value you entered for this login in the first part of this lab. Click the padlock to the right to hide the actual value as a secret.

![On the Definition*.Release to Integration page, on the Variables tab, two variables display: DeployUser (with Value VSTSRelease), and DeployPWD (with the value obscured).](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab3.2_Image19.jpg)

13. Click the **Triggers** menu item. **Continuous Deployment** should not be selected. This is different from our previous release. We will manually need to create a release here.
