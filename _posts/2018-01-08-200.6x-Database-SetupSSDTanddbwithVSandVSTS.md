### Task 1: Add SQL Server Database Tools (SSDT) to Visual Studio

Include the Data storage and processing workload to add the SQL Server Database Tools features to your Visual Studio installation.

If the **Data storage and processing** workload is already installed in Visual Studio, skip this section.

1. Start the **Visual Studio 2017 Installer** from your **Start Menu**. (This is separate from the Visual Studio IDE).

  ![The Visual Studio Products tab is selected. Under Installed, Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 displays with the options to Update or Launch.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image1.jpg)

2. Click the **Update** button to get a list of workloads. Check the box next to the **Data storage and processing** workload box.

  ![On the Workloads tab, the checkbox for Data storage and processing is selected.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image3.jpg)

  This process is described in this article: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio
" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Modify Visual Studio 2017 by adding or removing workloads and componentst </span></a>


3. Once the installation completes, close the **Visual Studio Installer**.

### Task 2: Create a new SSDT project

Use SSDT to create a new project and connect this to your database.

1. Start **Visual Studio 2017**. If you have not signed into Visual Studio.com, you may receive a dialog to do so. Use the credentials for your VisualStudio.com account.
  From the **File** menu, click **New**, then click **Project** (or click CTRL+Shift+N). You will receive a new project dialog. Click the **SQL Server** template on the left, and you should be presented with two options in the middle pane.

  ![New Project window, in the tree view in the left pane, Installed is expanded, Templates is expanded, and SQL Server is selected. In the right pane, SQL Server Database Project is selected.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image4.jpg)

2. Select the **SQL Server Database Project**, and type and enter WideWorldImporters-SSDT as the project name. Ensure the **Add to Source Control** check box is selected. Change the folder if you want to store this in a different location. 

3. Click **OK** to create the project. 

4. After the project is created, you will have a new project in the Solution Explorer. This will look similar to the image below.

  ![In Solution Explorer, WideWorldImporters-SSDT is selected.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image5.jpg)

You might also see a **ReadyRoll Core Edition** pane at the bottom of the **Visual Studio** window. If this is visible, you can unpin it to increase available space on your screen.

  ![The pin icon has a hover callout that says "Auto Hide".](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image6.jpg)

5. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **WideWorldImporters-SSDT** project and choose **Properties**. Select the **Project Settings** tab and ensure the **Target platform** is **SQL Server 2016**. On the toolbar, click **Save Selected Items**, then close the tab.

  ![Visual Studio Project Properties](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.4_Image7.jpg)

6. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **WideWorldImporters-SSDT** project, click **Import**, then click **Database**. 

  ![In Solution Explorer, WideWorldImporters-SSDT is selected. From its right-click menu, Import and then Database are selected.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image8.jpg)

7. In the **Import Database** window, click **Select Connection**. In the **Connect** window, configure your connection properties, then click **Connect**.

  ![Connection properties fields display: Server Name, Authentication, User Name, Password, and Database Name.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image9.jpg)

8. In the Import Database window, click **Start**. 

This will read the schema from the **WideWorldImporters-SSDT database** and import all the schema into the database project. When it completes successfully, click **Finish**.

  ![In the Import Database window Summary page, steps to import display.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image10.jpg)

9. Use Solution Explorer to browse the objects that have been imported to see how the folders are structured.

### Task 3: Make an initial commit to version control in your VSTS project

Publish our project to your VSTS project.

In this section, we want to commit our code to our Visual Studio Team Services project that we created in a previous lab.

1. Open the **Team Explorer** toolbar (or select it from beside Solution Explorer if it is already open), then click **Changes**. You should see a list of changes that also include the various Visual Studio project items. 

Note: If prompted to connect to Git, do so at this point.

  ![In the Team Explorer – Changes window, the following path is expanded: C:(local path)\Application\Stored Procedures, under which a list of stored procedures displays.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image11.jpg)

2. In the commit message (yellow) box, enter **WideWorldImporters-SSDT initial schema**. I typically use "Initial Commit" for the first set of code. After you have entered this, click **Commit All**.

3. After the commit is complete, you should see a message that confirms that. Click **Sync** in the message.

  ![In the Team Explorer – Changes window, a message displays that the Commit was created locally. A callout points to the Sync link, which enables you to share your changes with the server.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image12.jpg)

4. This will bring you to the synchronization dialog in Team Explorer, which allows you to publish this to a VSTS repo. Click the **Publish Git Repo** button under **Push to Visual Studio Team Services**.

  ![In Team Explorer – Synchronization, under Push to Visual Studio Team Services, a callout points to the Publish Git Repo button.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image13.jpg)

5. In the next dialog, you should see your account along with the Team Services domain filled in. If not, you might need to log in to your VSTS account from Visual Studio. In the upper right corner of Visual Studio, there is a sign-in link. Then click **Publish repository**. 

  Note: If an error is returned indicating that the repository already exists, click **Advanced**, then set the **Team Project** to your **WideWorldImporters-SSDT** repository, then click **Publish repository**.

  ![Advanced publish options display. Both the Team project and Repository name fields are set to WideWorldImporters-SSDT.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image14.jpg)

6. After this is complete, you should see a message at the top of Team Explorer that confirms the repo was pushed. Click **See it on the web**.

  ![In Team Explorer – Home, a message displays that says WideWorldImporters-SSDT was pushed. A callout points to the link, See it on the web.](../assets/setupssdtinvsandvsts-jan2018\Lab1.3_Image15.jpg)

7. A browser should open with your Visual Studio Team Services domain and project selected, on the **Code** tab. You should see your project listed. Review the contents, then close the browser window.
