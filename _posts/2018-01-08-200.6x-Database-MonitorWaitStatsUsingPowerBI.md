title:  Monitor Wait Statistics By Using Power BI
category: db
order: 12
---


Wait statistics are a measure of what Microsoft SQL Server spends time waiting for. Reducing waits is important in keeping performance high. Waits should be monitored regularly. Not all waits are relevant. In the following lab, you will use a common wait-stats query to produce a chart in Microsoft Power BI, to make it easy to visualize.

### Task 1: Install Power BI Desktop

We will install Power BI Desktop if it is not already installed.


If you already have Power BI Desktop installed, just open it and skip this first task.

1. In a browser, open the **Power BI portal** at **www.powerbi.com**. 

    ![The Power BI Portal website displays.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image1.jpg)

2. From the **Products** menu, click **Power BI Desktop**. On the download page, click **Advanced download options**, then on the page that appears, click **Download**.

    ![Under Choose the download you want, two download options display: PBIDesktop.msi, and PBIDesktop_x64.msi.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image2.jpg)

3. Download and install the version for your machine. (Use the x64 option for 64 bit systems). Then launch **Power BI Desktop**. If you have a Power BI account, click **Sign In** and then log on. (If you don't have an account, consider returning to the portal and setting up a trial account).

    ![The Power BI desktop displays.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image3.jpg)

### Task 2: Configure a Restricted Login

We will create a login that has permission to view server state.

1. In **SQL Server Management Studio**, connect to your local server. In **Object Explorer**, expand **Security** (at the server level), right-click **Logins**, and click **New Login**. Assign the login name as **PowerBIMonitor**, set an appropriate **password** for **SQL Server authentication**, and clear **Enforce password policy**.

    ![On the Login – New page, under Select a page, General is selected. PowerBIMonitor is set as the Login name, and the SQL Server authentication radio button is selected.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image5.jpg)

2. On the **Securables** page, click **Search**, then in the **Add Objects** pop-up, **select** your server, then click **OK**. In the **Explicit** permissions list, check the **Grant** column for **View server state**. Then click **OK** to create the login.

    ![On the Login – New page, under Securables, GREGP50 is selected. Under Permissions for GREGP50, on the Explicit tab, the Grant check box is selected for View server state.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image6.jpg)


### Task 3:Chart Wait Statistics Using Power BI

We will create a chart that shows SQL Server wait statistics using Power BI.

1. From the **Get Data** menu, click SQL Server. In the **SQL Server database** window, enter your server's details, enter **master** for the database, and enter the copy the following wait stats query from the following webpage: https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/wait-statistics-or-please-tell-me-where-it-hurts/ (note: do not copy the batch separator word GO), then click **OK**.

    ![Under SQL Server database, the Server field is set to .\SQL2016. Under Data Connectivity mode, Import is selected.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image4.jpg)

    There are many queries that can be used to retrieve wait stats. Paul Randal from SQL Skills has provided the one that is most commonly used at the time of writing. You could adapt this lab to use any other query that returns similar data.

2. When prompted for credentials, select the **Database** page, enter **PowerBIMonitor** for the **User name**, and the **password** that you assigned to the user, then click **Connect**.

    ![On the SQL Server database page, in the left pane, Database is selected. In the right pane, User name is PowerBIMonitor.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image7.jpg)

    If prompted about encryption support, click **OK**.

3. When the query preview appears, click **Edit**.

    ![The SDUPROD: master query preview table displays with multiple columns. At the bottom, three buttons display: Load, Edit, and Cancel.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image8.jpg)

4. In the **Query Editor** (separate window that should open), click to select the column heading for **WaitType**. While holding the Control key, also select the **Percentage** column, right-click it, and click **Remove Other Columns**. You should be left with just two columns.

    ![In the Query Editor window, on the Home tab, in the left pane under Queries, Query1 is selected. In the right pane, only two columns display: WaitType, and Percentage.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image10.jpg)

5. In the Query Settings pane, change the Name to Wait Statistics.

    ![In the Query Settings pane, under Properties, the Name field is set to Wait Statistics.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image9.jpg)

6. From the **Close & Apply** drop-down list, click **Close & Apply**. Your Fields list should then show the fields from the query that you have configured.

    ![The Visualizations and Fields columns from the Power BI Desktop display. In the Fields column, under Wait Statistics, the Percentage and WaitType fields are available.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image11.jpg)

7. Check the check box beside **WaitType**, then also check **Percentage**. A table of waits should appear. (The values shown will differ depending upon your server)

    ![Screenshot of a WaitType table.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image13.jpg)

8. Make sure the table of waits is selected, then in the **Visualizations** section, click **Pie chart**.

    ![The Visualizations palette displays.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image12.jpg)

9. Drag the chart to increase its size until it occupies about half the screen. From the **File** menu, click **Save**. Choose an appropriate folder, set the **File name** to **CurrentServerWaits**, and click **Save**.

    ![The WaitType information now displays in pie-chart format.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image14.jpg)

10. Note that the data can be refreshed by clicking **Refresh** on the toolbar.

    ![A callout points to the Refresh tile on the Ribbon.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image15.jpg)

### Task 4: (Optional) Publish a Wait Statistics Dashboard to Power BI

We will publish the dashboard to Power BI and view it on a phone, tablet, or PC.

1. If you have signed onto Power BI, click **Publish** in the toolbar.

    ![Screenshot of the Publish tile.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image16.jpg)

2. When the **Publishing to Power BI** window indicates success, click **Got it**.

3. Log on to the **Power BI** site.

4. In the left-hand pane, expand **My Workspace** (if necessary).

5. You should see **CurrentServerWaits** in your **REPORTS** list. Click to **select** it, then in the top right of the report, hover until the **Pin Visual** option appears. Select it.

    ![A callout points to the Pin icon.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image17.jpg)

6. In the **Pin to dashboard** window, configure the options as follows, then click **Pin**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard page, in the left pane, the Percentage Pie Chart displays for WAITTYPE. In the right pane, under Where would you like to pin to, the New dashboard radio button is selected, as is the Pin button at the bottom.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image18.jpg)

7. In the left-hand pane, select the **Current Server Wait Statistics** entry in the DASHBOARDS section.

    ![In the left pane, under My Dashboard, a callout points to Current Server Wait Statistics.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image19.jpg)

8. Note that natural language query would also work with this data. Click **Ask a question about your data**, and enter the following query:

    ![A stacked bar chart displays top wait type by percentage.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image20.jpg)

9. If you have a phone connected with the **Power BI app**, browse the dashboard on the phone.

### Final thoughts

We have published static data. If you want this data to periodically refresh, you would need to do the following additional steps (not described here):

* Install the Power BI Gateway (certificate based and secure). Details are here: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-gateway-getting-started/
* Configure the Gateway to provide this data source.
* Schedule the query to refresh periodically. (In the **DATASETS** section in the Power BI portal, choose the **SCHEDULE REFRESH** option.)

    ![In the left pane, Datasets is selected. In the right, CurrentServerWaits pane, Schedule Refresh is selected.](../assets/monitorwaitstatsusingpowerbi-jan2018\Lab4.1_Image22.jpg)
