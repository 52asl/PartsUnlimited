<h3><span style="color: #0000CD;">Lab Tasks: </span></h3>

In this lab, we will begin making a variety of changes to our database and committing them to version control.

- Alter an existing stored procedure
- Add a new sequence
- Check in changes



<h3><span style="color: #0000CD;">Estimated Lab Time:</span></h3>

- approx. 30 minutes  




### Task 1: Alter an existing stored procedure

We will examine the process for altering a stored procedure through code.


1. Open your **SSDT** project **WideWorldImporters-SSDT** in Visual Studio. The project should contain database objects from the previous lab. (The **Recent Projects and Solutions** option from the **File** menu might help with opening this project).

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio with the WideWorldImporters-SSDT project folders displaying.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image1.jpg)

2. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Website** folder, expand the **Stored Procedures** folder and note the available procedures.

    ![In Solution Explorer, the Website folder is expanded, and Stored Procedures is expanded. Under Stored Procedures, SearchForStockItems.sql is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image2.jpg)

3. Right-click the  **SearchForStockItems** stored procedure and click **Open**.

    ![The SearchForStockItems.sql stored procedure displays.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image3.jpg)

4. Add a line to display the brand as follows:

    ![In the SearchForStockItems.sql file, callout arrows point to si.StockItemName, and si.Brand.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image4.jpg)

5. From the **File** menu, click **Save SearchForStockItems.sql**. In **Solution Explorer**, note that the lock icon has changed to a check mark to indicate that the file is now checked out.

    ![In Solution Explorer, SearchForStockItems.sql is selected, and a callout arrow points to the checkmark next to the name.](../../Linked_Image_Files\ab2.1_Image5.jpg)

6. Close the **SearchForStockItems.sql** tab.


### Task 2: Add a new sequence

We will add a new sequence to the database.

Let add a new sequence to the database. We want to add a sequence that will be used as a default for a new table that is being developed.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Sequences** folder, then right-click the **Sequences** folder (second level folder), then click **Add**, then click **New Item**. In the **Add New Item - WideWorldImporters-SSDT** window, in the center pane select **Sequence**, in the Name enter **CustomerSpecialDealID**, then click **Add**.

    ![In the Add New Item - WideWorldImporters-SSDT window, in the left pane, SQL Server is selected. In the center pane, Sequence is selected. The Name field is set to CustomerSpecialDealID, and the Add button is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image6.jpg)

2. Then modify the code as shown.

    ![In Visual Studio, on the CustomerSpecialDealID tab, a callout points to (Sequences) on line one, which reads: CREATE SEQUENCE (Sequences).(CustomerSpecialDealID). On line 7, a callout points to “CACHE 100.”](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image7.jpg)

3. From the **File** menu, click **Save All**.

4. Close the CustomeSpecialDealID.sql tab and in **Solution Explorer**, note the + icon for a newly added item. 

    ![The newly added item, CustomerSpecialDealID.sql, has a plus icon next to it.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image8.jpg)


### Task 3: Check in code

We will check our changes into the VCS.

1. Before checking in our code, let's ensure that it builds OK. From the **Build** menu, click **Build WideWorldImporters-SSDT**. When the build completes, in the **Output** pane, check that it was successful.

    ![In the Output code, a callout points to the Build: 1 Succeeded message. Successfuly build output](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image9.jpg)

2. In the **Team Explorer** pane, click **Changes**.

    ![In Tean Explorer - Home, under Project, Changes is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image10.jpg)

3. Add a commit message as shown.

    ![Commit message is as follows: Added branch to stock item search. Added CustomerSpecialDealID sequence.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image11.jpg)

4. From the **Drop-down** menu beside **Commit All**, click **Commit All and Push**.

    ![Commit All is selected, and from its drop-down menu, Commit All and Push is selected.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image12.jpg)

5. When all steps have finished executing, you should receive a message indicating success.

    ![In Team Explorer - synchronization, A callout points to the message, Successfully pushed to origin/master.](../../Linked_Image_Files\Lab2.1_Image14.jpg)
