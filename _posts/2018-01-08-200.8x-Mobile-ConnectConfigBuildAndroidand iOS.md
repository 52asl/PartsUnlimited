### Task 1: Connect to Your Repository Service

1. Select the Android or Xamarin.Android app that you want to work with.

2. Click the Build tab on the left menu. 

3. Connect to your repository service: GitHub, Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), or BitBucket.

4. After you are connected, choose from the list of branches in your repo. 


### Task 2: Configuring and Building Your App

1. Click the Configure Build button on the branch detail blade. The Build Configuration blade will appear pre-populated with fields from your selected branch. There are five sections in the configuration of an App Center build: Build, Sign, Test, Distribute, and Advanced. See these sections in the figure below.

2. Select the project that you want to build in the project drop-down.  If no project is found, check that it’s shared and that you’ve selected the correct branch, and that everything is checked in. 

3. Choose the release configuration from the drop-down. 

4. For Xamarin.Android builds, select the Mono Version to run the build on.

5. Set the Build Freqency to the basic setting Manually Choose When to run builds.

6. For native Android projects, enter your build.gradle file. Your build.gradle file contains dependencies, build types, build tools version, and product flavors.

7. Click Save & Build. Building may take a few minutes.

8. When the build is completed, check if it succeeded.  If it did not, click on the build and click Download Logs to see what went wrong. 

9. If the build succeeded, click the build to bring up the build details. Select Download, then download build.

10. Take the .apk download and install and run the build on your own Android simulator.
