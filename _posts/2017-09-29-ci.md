HOL - Parts Unlimited WebSite Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services
====================================================================================
In this lab we have an application called PartsUnlimited. We want to set up
Visual Studio Team Services to be able continuously integrate code into the master
branch of code. This means that whenever code is committed and pushed to the
master branch, we want to ensure that it integrates into our code correctly to
get fast feedback. To do so, we are going to be setting up a Continuous Integration build (CI) that
will allow us to compile and run unit tests on our code every time a commit is
pushed to Visual Studio Team Services.

### Pre-requisites: ###
- Complete [Getting Started](../GettingStarted.md) task.
-   An active Visual Studio Team Services account.

	 [Sign up for Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services)

Note: Some screenshots and sections of the video displayed here may be different to what is showing in VSTS as you step through the lab. This is due to the rapid pace of change in VSTS. Screenshots and video will be updated periodiaclly but some differences may still be present.


### Tasks Overview: ###

**1. Import Source Code into your VSTS Account:** In this step, you will connect your own Visual Studio Team Services account, download the PartsUnlimited source code, and then push it to your own Visual Studio Team Services account. There are a few ways to do this such as using the Git command line, or using Visual Studio.  

> Note: VSTS does support GitHub source code integration for use with VSTS builds, but we will not do that in this instance. Instead we will use a repo we set up for use by ourselves.

**2. Create Continuous Integration Build:** In this step, you will create a build definition that will be triggered every time a commit is pushed to your repository in Visual Studio Team Services.

**3. Test the CI Trigger in Visual Studio Team Services:** In this step, test the Continuous Integration build (CI) build we created by changing code in the Parts Unlimited project with Visual Studio Team Services.

### I: Import Source Code into your VSTS Account with Git

We want to push the application code to your Visual Studio Team Services account in
order to use VSTS Build.

> **Talking Point:** For this lab we are using the VSTS Git project. The next couple of steps will allow you to add the PartUnlimited source to the Git master repository.

If you haven't already, create a new team project in your Visual Studio Team Services account that uses Git for source control.

**1.** Clone the repository to a local directory.

Create a parent **Working Directory** on your local file system. For instance, on a Windows OS you can create the following directory:

`C:\Source\Repos`

Open a command line (one that supports Git) and change to the directory you created above.

Clone the repository with the following command. You can paste in the URL if you copied it in Step 1.  In the example below, the clone will be copied into a directory named HOL. Feel free to use whatever directory name you like, or leave it blank to use the default directory name:

	git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited.git HOL

After a few seconds of downloading, all of the code should now be on your local machine.

Move into the directory that was just created.  In a Windows OS (and assuming you used HOL as the directory name), you can use this command:

	cd HOL

**2.** Remove the link to GitHub.




The GIt repo that you just downloaded currently has a remot called _origin_ that points to the GitHub repo.  You can check the repo details by running the command


	git remote show origin


or 


	git remote -v 


Since we won't be using the origin course any longer, we can delete the reference.

To delete the GitHub remote, run the command:

	git remote remove origin


**3.** Find the URL to access the VSTS Git repo

First, we need to find the URL to empty Git repository in VSTS.  If you remember your account name, and the Team Project name you created, the URL to the default Git repo is easily assembled:

	https://<account>.visualstudio.com\_git\<project>

Alternatively, you can use a web browser to browse to your account, click into your project, and click the Code tab to get to your default Git repository:

	https://<account>.visualstudio.com

Additionally, in the web page below you will see the two commands that we will use to push the existing code to VSTS.

**4.** Add the link to VSTS and push your local Git repo

In the local directory from Step 1, use the following command to add VSTS as the Git remote named _origin_. You can either type the URL you found in Step 3, or simply copy the first command from the VSTS web page.

	git remote add origin https://<account>.visualstudio.com\<project>\_git\<project>



Now you can push the code, including history, to VSTS:

	git push -u origin --all



Congratualtions, your code should not be in VSTS!

### II. Create Continuous Integration Build

A continuous integration build will give us the ability check whether the code
we checked in can compile and will successfully pass any automated tests that we
have created against it.

**1.** Go to your **account’s homepage**:

	https://<account>.visualstudio.com


**2.** Go to your profile and and then select your team project.

**3.** Once on the project’s home page, click on the **Build** hub at the top of the page, then on **All Definitions**, and then on **New Definition**.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSNewBuildDef1.png>)

**4.** Select the **Empty** build definition, and then click **Apply**.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSNewBuildDefemptytemplate.png>)

>**Note:** Scrolling through the available templates you can see that is is possible to build many app types on VSTS, including Universal Windows Apps & Xamarin Android/IOS, Xcode and many more.

**5.** After clicking the **Apply** button, you are brought to the new build definition **Process** page
- Leave the name as the default value i.e. **HOL-CI**;
- Under Agent queue choose **Hosted VS2017** ;

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSHOstedagentandname1.png>)

**6.** Click on **Get sources**, to define the sources for the build definition
- Under **From** choose **This project**, note the other available sources you can choose in your VSTS build;
- Under **Repository** choose **HOL** i.e. your project
- Under **Branch** chhose **master** 

Leave the remaining values at their default. You can also view the **Advanced settings** to see what options are available, but do not change anything.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBuildgetsources1.png>)


**7.** Click on **Phase 1 - Run on agent** , and then click the **+** sign to add a task to the phase.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSbuildaddtask1.png>)

**8.** On the **Add tasks** page, select **Utility** and then add a **PowerShell** task (not Azure PowerShell available under Deploy) and configure it as follows.


- Version = **< default value >**
- Display name= **dotnet, restore, build and publish**
- Type= **File Path**
- Script Path= **build.ps1** (Select this using the ellipsis button at end of Script Path box, and choose **HOL\build.ps1**)
- Arguments= **$(BuildConfiguration) $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory) $(build.stagingDirectory)**
- Advanced > Working folder = **$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)**
- Control Options = < ensure **Enabled** is checked>

> **Note:** The build.ps1 script contains commands using the **dotnet.exe** executable used by .Net Core.  The build script does the following: restore, build, test, publish, and produces an MSDeploy zip package.

> **Note:** Ensure there is a space between the Argument variables as is shown here, **$(BuildConfiguration) $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory) $(build.stagingDirectory)** otherwise you may receive a variable error when the build is run

When you are finished click **Save & Queue** and choose **Save**, then click **Save** again in the **Save build definition** dialogue to confirm, accepting the default values.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSbuildaddtaskPosh2.png>)

**9.** Click the **+** sign on **Phase 1 - Run on agent**, select **Test** and then add a **Publish Test Results** task, configuring it as follows, again saving it after you have finished configuring it

- Version = **< default value >**
- Display name= **Publish Test results **/testresults.xml**
- Test result format = **VSTest**
- Test result files= ****/testresults.xml**
- Search folder= **default i.e. $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)**
- Merge test results=**< default value i.e. blank >**
- Test run title=**< default value i.e. blank >**
- Advanced= **< default values >**
- Control Options = < ensure **Enabled** is checked>



 ![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBuildTaskPubTestRes1.png>)



**10.** Click the **+** sign on **Phase 1 - Run on agent** again, select **Utility** and then add a **Copy Files** task, configuring it as follows, again saving it after you have finished configuring it

- Version = **< default value >**
- Display Name = **Copy Files to: $(build.stagingDirectory)\drop**
- Source Folder= **$(build.stagingDirectory)**
- Contents= **\*\*\\\*.zip**
- Target Folder= $(build.stagingDirectory)\drop
- Advanced= **< default values >**
- Control Options = < ensure **Enabled** is checked>




> **Note:** The build generates individual files and folders for the app(dlls etc) and places them in a parts unlimited folder on the agent something like d:\a\1\a… it also generates a zip, partsunlimted.zip, which is all these loose files in a zip. This **Copy Files* task, just moves that zip file to a separate folder which can be picked up and deployed. i.e. to separate it cleanly from the other files and allow it be picked up to be published as an artifact and then deployed. i.e. Copying all files from d:\a\1\a\partsunlimited.zip to d:\a\1\a\drop\partsunlimited.zip.

 ![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBuildTaskCopyFiles1.png>)


**11.** Click the **+** sign on **Phase 1 - Run on agent** again, select **Utility** and then add a **Publish Build Artifacts** task, configuring it as follows, again saving it after you have finished configuring it.

- Version = **< default value >**
- Display Name= **Publish Artifact: drop**
- Path to Publish= **$(build.stagingDirectory)\drop**
- Artifact Name=**drop**
- Artifact Type=**Server**
- Control Options = < ensure **Enabled** is checked>

> **Note:** This task publishes the zip file as an artifact that can later be used in the release definition. i.e. something like upload 'd:\a\1\a\drop' to file container: '#/779197/drop', 

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBuildTaskPublishBuildArtifact1.png>)



**12** Select the **Variables** page, then click **+ Add** and add the below variable. This variable will be used by the **build.ps1** PowerShell script. Again, save the definition after you are finished.

- Name = **BuildConfiguration** 
- Value = **release**

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBuildVariable1.png>)

**13.** Click on the **Triggers** tab and enable the **Continuous integration (CI)** option to build the solution everytime a change is checked in. Also make sure the that the repo settings for CI are configured as you wish, in this case as per the below, again saving the build definitin after you are finished with the configuration.

-  **Type = Include** 
-  **Branch Specification = master** 


![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBiuldCITrigger1.png>)

> **Note:** To enable or disable Continuous integration in your project, move the **Continuous integration (CI)** slider to **Enabled** or **Disabled**. You can select which branch you wish to monitor, as well.

**14.** Hover the mouse over the build definition name, near the top of the page, and click on the **blue pencil** icon to edit the build definition name to **dotnet restore, build, test, copy and publish and click OK

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSEditBuildDefName1.png>)

### III. Test the CI Trigger in Visual Studio Team Services

We will now test the **Continuous Integration build (CI)** build we created by changing code in the Parts Unlimited project with Visual Studio Team Services.

**1.** Select the **Code** hub and then select your your repo, **HOL**.

**2.** Navigate to **/src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/Controllers** in the PartsUnlimited project, then click on the ellipsis to the right of **HomeController.cs** and click **Edit**.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSTriggerCI1.png>)

**2.** After clicking **Edit**, add in text (i.e. *This is a test of CI*) after the last *Using* statement. Once complete, click **Commit**.

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSTriggerCI2.png>)

**3.** Click **Build and Release** and select **Build**. On the **Build Definitions** page, beside your build definition click on the build number, i.e. in this case **#43**, to view the build that we just trigerred with the commit. Build numbers will increase in increments as they are run

![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBUildInProgress1>)

**4.** After you have clicked on the **Build Number**, and you should get the build in progress. Here you can view the command being run by the hosted build agent, and the current steps that the build is on.
![](</PartsUnlimited/assets/ci2/VSTSBUildInProgress2.png>)

**4.** Click on the **Build Number** on the top left and you should get a build summary similar to this, which includes test results. You can also view and download the generated Artifacts form within here by clicking on **Artifacts**.

Next steps
----------

In this lab, you learned how to push new code to Visual Studio Team Services, setup a Git repo and create a Continuous
Integration build that runs when new commits are pushed to the master branch.
This allows you to get feedback as to whether your changes made breaking syntax
changes, or if they broke one or more automated tests, or if your changes are
okay.
