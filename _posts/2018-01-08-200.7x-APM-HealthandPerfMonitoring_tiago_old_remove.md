The sales of PartsUnlimited is expanded globally to multiple regions. These regions are Asia, West Europe, and North Europe. From Asia, a lot of traffic is expected on the search part of the website, due to interest in Jumper Leads from that area. The product owners from PartsUnlimited want to monitor the availability of the website from all regions. Next to availability monitoring, they also want to be sure the website stays responsive when an enormous load is taken from Asia on the search part of the site.  

Validate Europe is still available when the Asia load is generated

11. Run the web test scenario and validate all requests are responding within 1 second. 

    Note: when a test step returns a 404 on a jquery request, set the property ‘parse dependent requests’ to false.  


12. Set the multi-step test as an availability test for Europe regions by opening the Azure portal and go to the Application Insights resource.  
13. Select availability tests.  

14. Add the CheckoutProductScenario.webtest multi-step tests.

8. Delete any requests made to any host different than *.azurewebsites.net (e.g., calls to App Insights like dc.services.visualstudio.com) to make sure the test isn’t testing any external service like Application Insights.  

9. Run the performance test to validate the run successes.   

    Note: when a test step returns a 404 on a jquery request, set the property `parse dependent requests` to *false*.  

10. Save the WebPerformance test as SearchProducts.webtest.  

11. Add a Load Test to the WebAndLoadTests project.

    - Set load test run settings to 10 minutes.  

    ![](../assets/healthperfmonitoring-jan2018/healthperfmon_14.png) 




    - Set Load Pattern to ‘Step Load’ maximum user count 10.000  


    ![](../assets/healthperfmonitoring-jan2018/healthperfmon_15.png) 

    - Select the SearchProducts.webtest as the only test to execute.  

    ![](../assets/healthperfmonitoring-jan2018/healthperfmon_16.png)
