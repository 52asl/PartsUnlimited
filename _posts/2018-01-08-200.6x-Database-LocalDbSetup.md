- approx. 30 minutes  



### Task 1: Download WideWorldImporters sample database

In this step, you will get the sample database from the official Microsoft repository.

1. The Microsoft Database Sample Database repository is located at [https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/). This is the location for all sample databases. 

2. We will be using the WideWorldImporters sample database, so naviate to [https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0) to find the various versions of WideWorldImporters that are available for download.

3. Download the Azure SQL Database Standard tier .bacpac file for the OLTP version. Since we will deploy to Azure SQL database and use LocalDB, we want this file: [WideWorldImporters-Standard.bacpac](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/wide-world-importers-v1.0/WideWorldImporters-Standard.bacpac).

    This should be located on the page below the SQL Server 2016 SP1 versions and Azure SQL Database Premium tier samples.

4. Save this file in a location on your local machine.

### Task 2: Restore multiple copies of the database

In this step, you will restore the various development copies that are needed for future labs.

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio

2. Connect to your LocalDB instance. The address, by default for Visual Studio 2017, is: **(localdb)\ProjectsV13**. The connection dialog is shown below:

    ![Management Studio Connection Dialog](../assets/setuplocaldb-jan2018\Lab_1.1_Image2_GL.jpg)

3. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the **Databases** folder and click **Import Data-tier Application**, as shown below.

4. Skip the first dialog of the wizard by clicking **Next**

5. On the **Import Settings** page of the wizard, ensure the **Import from local disk** radio button is selected. Click the **Browse** button and navigate to the location of the **WideWorldImporters-Standard.bacpac** file that you downloaded in the first part of this lab.

    ![Import DAC Wizard choose import file](../assets/setuplocaldb-jan2018\Lab_1.1_Image5_GL.jpg)

    Click Next to continue.

6. On the **Database Settings** page, change the **New database name** text box to **WideWorldImporters-SSDT**. The data file path and log file path default to the AppData folder under your local user. Leave these at the defaults.

7. Review the **Summary** page, then click **Finish**.

    ![Import DAC Wizard Summary](../assets/setuplocaldb-jan2018\Lab_1.1_Image7_GL.jpg)

8. On the **Results** page, when processing finishes, all items should show success. Click **Close** once you have reviewed this page.

9. Verify that the database has been created by expanding the **Databases** folder in **Object Explorer**. There should be a database named **WideWorldImporters-SSDT**

10. Repeat steps 3-9 to create another new database named **WideWorldImporters-RR**
