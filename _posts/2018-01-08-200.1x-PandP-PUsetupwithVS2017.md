    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_asp,netandazurecoponents.png)



3. Install <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-5.1.1&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-4.4.0" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Azure Power Shell</span></a>, as per the steps in the link provided here i.e.
    Open a Windows PowerShell command line console, or the PowerShell ISE, and run the below command accepting all prompts. 

    ```powershell
    Install-Module AzureRM -AllowClobber
    ```
   Once installed you can import the **AzureRM** module into your active Powershell session by running the below command when you need.

    ```powershell
    Import-Module AzureRM
    ```
    You can view the imported and available modules in your active PowerShell session by running the command
    ```powershell
    Get-Module
    ```

4. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.12.3" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">NodeJS</span></a>


    **Note:** Do **not** use the current version, which is 8.9.4 LTS as of Jan 2018, which is labelled **8.9.4 LTS - Recommended For Most Users**, as in the screenshot below. Using this version may result in node-sass build errors when you go to build your PartsUnlimited solution in Visual Studio. **ver 6x** has the build tools installation embedded into it, whereas ver 8x doesn’t. 

    If you wish to use the latest **Node.js 8.9.4 LTS**, after installing it, you will need to run **npm install –g windows-build-tools** as this will install the missing build tools. This needs to be run as administrator. 


    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_nodjsinstall.png)

    Install **version 6x**, we recommend **v6.12.3**, which is available on <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.12.3" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">this page</span></a>, then locate and click on on **node-v6.12.3-x64.msi**


    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_nodev6123x64msi.png)

    Complete the wizard accepting the defaults. You should not have to restart after install.

    You can also view general Node.js install details on the <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Node.js home page</span></a>


5. Then run the following commands on a command line as administrator:

```
    npm install bower -g
    npm install grunt-cli -g
```


### Task 2: Get the source code
1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**
2. Go to **View > Team Explorer**
3. In the **Team Explorer - Home** window on thr right hand side, click **Manage Connections**

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_manageconnections.png)

4. Under the **Local Git Repositories** section click **Clone** and enter the values and click **Clone**

    - URL of reop to clone: **https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited.git**
    - Path for local copy of repo to be placed: **C:\Repos\VS2017\PartsUnlimited** (or any local path you wish to use.)

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_clonerepo.png)

    the repo should start to clone, as per below screenshot

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_clonerepo1.png)

    and when complete the repo files should be displayed in **Solution Explorer** as below.

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_clonerepo3.png)


### Task 3: Build the PartsUnlimited solution within Visual Studio
1. On the **Home** page of the **Team Explorer** window, open the solution by double-clicking **PartsUnlimited.sln**. 

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_pusoln.png)


    If you do not see it listed in **Solution Explorer - Folder View** window, go to **File > Open > Project/Solution...** and navigate the local repository folder to open **PartsUnlimited.sln** i.e. depending on where you placed your local repo, it will be something like **C:\Repos\VS2017\PartsUnlimited\PartsUnlimited.sln** 

2. After opening the solution, wait for the **Output** window Package Manager pane to show "Restore complete" and "Total time" messages.

    The solution will go through a series of stages when opening, one of which installing required packages. This can take 5 to 10 minutes to complete on first opening i.e.

    **Installing packages** > displayed in bottom left hand corner of VS2017 window, along with the *Line* value having moving arrow graphics associatd with it.

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_installingpackages.png)

    and when complete it will say **Ready**, the **Line** value will not have a moving graphic and the **Output** will say **Finished**

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_installing3.png)

    There should be six projects listed under the PartsUnlimited Solution in **Solution Explorer**

    - **PartsUnlimited.Models**
    - **PartsUnlimited.UnitTests**
    - **PartsUnlimited.WebJobs.ProcessOrder**
    - **PartsUnlimited.WebJobs.UpdateProductInventory**
    - **PartsUnlimitedEnv**
    - **PartsUnlimitedWebsite**
        
    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_sixprojects.png)

3. Expand the projects and ensure there are no errors listed under them, particularly under dependencies.

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_websiteexpanded.png)


4. Go to **Build > Build Solution** and the solution should build successfully, and display output with no errors as in the screenshot below

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_buildsuccessful.png)



- **Build Errors and Solutions**

    1. If when building you receive an error as per the below

        ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_builderrorlist1.png)

        go to the output tab and view the full message output, as per the screenshot below

        ![Build error output message](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\PUVS2017_error_output_2.png)

        Missing ...website.dll or binding errors can usually be addressed by performing the below steps.

        Open up a **cmd** or **Powershell** window as administrator, go to the repo where the PartsUnlimitedWebsite is located i.e. **C:\<repository path>\PartsUnlimited\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite**

        then run the below command and try again to build the solution.

        ```
        npm rebuild node-sass 
        ```

    2. If you continue to get node-sass errors check the version of **nodejs** that you have installed by running the command

        ```
        node- v
        ```

        If it is not **v6x...**, but is **8x...** unsinstall **Node.js**. 
        
        - In windows you can do this in **Control Panel** > **Program and Features**, right clicking Node.js and selecting uninstall and completing the wizard. 

        - Once uninstalled, install **version 6.12.3** as outlined in **Task 1: Step 4** above.

        - Once installed, try build the solution again.

        - The **Node.js 8.9.4 LTS**, does not have build tools installed by default as the v6.12.3 does. If you do not wish to uninstall the ver 8x, you can also try to install the windows build tools by running the following command form the command line.
        
        ```
        npm install –g windows-build-tools
        ```

        this will install the missing build tools. This needs to be run as administrator. Then try to build the solution again. 


    3. If you are continuing to get errors, sometimes just closing and then re-opening Visual Studio and re-trying to build the solution can work, otherwise you can also try the following.
        - Close Visual Studio.
        - Open PowerShell and navigate to the repository folder, usually **C:\<repo location>\PartsUnlimited**.
        - Execute the command below

        ```
        git clean -fdx`.
        ```

        This will clean your working directory and make sure your code is in sync with the repository.
    
        Open the solution on Visual Studio and rebuild the application again.

    4. If you are continuing to get errors, you can try removing all npm packages or uninstalling and re-installing the node-sass package using the commands

        ```
        npm uninstall node-sass
        ```

        and then
        ```
        npm install node-sass
        ```

    5. As a last resport, you could also remove the solution from Visual Studio and delete the repo, then try again from the start. Sometimes errors have been introduced in some form and a clean start will address these. 
    
        I have also seen instances where different accounts being used for a local environment and visual studio instances have resulted in access issues to installed files, where no-admintrator accounts have been used, so ensure any locally installed files are accessible from the account you are using to run visual studio. Using administrator level accounts or the same account for both could be one solution.


    6. Also, You may see an error related to **bower** being deprecated and prompting you to migrate your application to **Yarn**. It is fine to ignore that error message for our purposes.

### Task 4: Debug the PartsUnlimited website using Visual Studio
5. Go to **Debug** > **Start Debugging** to launch the web application and attach the debugger.

6. Perform some actions on the PartsUnlimited website in the actual browser in which it has been launched.

7. Return to the Visual Studio debugger and scroll through the Output on the **Output** tab. This is the debugger tracking the actions performed on the site by you.

8. In Visual Studio go to **Debug** > **Stop Debugging** to stop the debugging and return the **Solution Explorer**.
