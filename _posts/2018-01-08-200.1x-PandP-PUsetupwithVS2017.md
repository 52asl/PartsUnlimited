The purpose of this lab is to provide some details for setting up the PartsUnlimted sample application for use with Visual Studio 2017. Its is an optional lab and only relevant if you intend using Visual Studio with the PartsUnlimted for later labs. 

Visual Studio will be required for some labs in the [Microsoft Profrssional Program (MPP) for DevOps](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/devops/) course track but will not be required for the majority of the labs in the DevOps courses.

The following instruction is for Windows. For Linux or Mac OS X, please see

### Task 1: Set up your local machine
1. Install [Visual Studio 2017](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517106). Visual Studio Community 2017 version is available to use for free if you need.

2. During the VS2017 installation select the following components
    - **ASP. NET and web development**
    - **Azure development**

   Note: If VS2017  is already installed you can add the required components by accessing ***Tools > Get Tools and Features*** from within Visual Studio.

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_asp,netandazurecoponents.png)

3. Install [Azure Power Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-5.1.1&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-4.4.0), as per the steps in the link i.e.
    Open a Windows PowerShell command line console, or the PowerShell ISE, and run the below command accepting all prompts. 

    ```powershell
    Install-Module AzureRM -AllowClobber
    ```
   Once installed you can import the **AzureRM** module into your active Powershell session by running the below command when you need.

    ```powershell
    Import-Module AzureRM
    ```
    You can view the imported and available modules in your active PowerShell session by running the command
    ```powershell
    Get-Module
    ```

4. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 


    **Note:** Do **not** use the current version, which is 8.9.4 LTS as of Jan 2018, which is labelled **8.9.4 LTS - Recommended For Most Users**, as in the screenshot below. Using this version may result in node-sass build errors when you go to build your PartsUnlimited solution in Visual Studio. 

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_nodjsinstall.png)

    Install **version 6x**, we recommend **v6.12.3**, which is available by clicking on the **LTS Schedule** link on the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) page, then click on on **6x**

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_nodejsltsschedule.png)
  

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_nodev6123x64msi.png)

    Complete the wizard accepting the defaults. You should not have to restart after install.

5. Then run the following commands on a command line as administrator:

```
    npm install bower -g
    npm install grunt-cli -g
```


### Task 2: Get the source code
1. Open **Visual Studio 2017**
2. Go to **View > Team Explorer**
3. In the **Team Explorer-Home ** window on thr right hand side, click Manage Connections*

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_manageconnections.png)

4. Under the Local Git Repositories section click **Clone** and enter the values and click **Clone**

    - URL of reop to clone:  https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited.git
    - Path for local copy of repo to be placed: **C:\Repos\VS2017\PartsUnlimited** (or any local path you wish to use.)

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_clonerepo.png)

    the repo should star to clone as per below screenshot

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_clonerepo1.png)

    and when complete the repo files shoudl be siudsplayed in **Solution Explorer** as below.

    ![Pillar Data](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_clonerepo3.png)


### Task 3: Begin working with the Parts Unlimited solution
1. On the **Home** page of the **Team Explorer** window, open the solution by double-clicking **PartsUnlimited.sln** listed under the Solutions section. 

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_pusoln.png)


    If you do not see it listed in **Solution Explorer - Folder View** window, go to **File > Open > Project/Solution...** and navigate the local repository folder to open **PartsUnlimited.sln** i.e. depending on where you placed your local repo, it will be something like **C:\Repos\VS2017\PartsUnlimited\PartsUnlimited.sln** 

2. After opening the solution, wait for the Output window Package Manager pane to show "Restore complete" and "Total time" messages.

    It will go through a series of stages when opening, one of which installing required packages. This can take 5 to 10 minutes to complete firat opening i.e.

    **Installing packages** > displayed in bottom left hand corner of VS2017 window, along with the **Line* value having a moving arrow graphic associatd with it.

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_installingpackages.png)

    and when finished it will say **Ready**, the **Line** value will not have a moving graphic and the **Output** will say **Finished**

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_installing3.png)

    There should be six projects listed under the PartsUnlimited Solution in **Solution Explorer**

    - **PartsUnlimited.Models**
    - **PartsUnlimited.UNitTests**
    - **PartsUnlimited.WebJobs.ProcessOrder**
    - **PartsUnlimited.WebJobs.UpdateProductInventory**
    - **PartsUnlimitedEnv**
    - **PartsUnlimitedWebsite**
        
    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_sixprojects.png)

3. Expand the projectrs and ensure there are no errors listed under them.

    ![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_websiteexpanded.png)


3. Go to Build -> Build Solution.


Errors
If you receive an error as per the below

![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_builderrorlist1.png)


Open up a **cmd** or **Powershell** window as administrator, go to the repo where the PartsUnlimitedWebsite is located i.e. **C:\<repository path>\PartsUnlimited\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite**

then run the command

```
npm rebuild node-sass 
```

![Pu solution file](../assets/setuppuwithvs2017-jan2018\VS_builderrorlist1.png)


Then rebuild the solution.

If that doesn't work check the version of nodjs that is installed in your environment by running the command

nodje

    > If the build fails try to clean your repository and build again. This usually happens because VS2017 downloaded an incorrect reference package before.
    > - Close Visual Studio.
    > - Open PowerShell and navigate to the repository folder, usually `C:\Users\<user>\Source\Repos\PartsUnlimited`.
    > - Execute the command `git clean -fdx`. This will clean your working directory and make sure your code is in sync with the repository.
    > - Open the solution on Visual Studio and rebuild the application again.

4. Go to Debug -> Start Debugging to launch the web application and attach the debugger.
