title:  Deploy Application to Azure Kubernetes Service
category: IaC
order: 12
---

In this lab we will create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure CLI. We will deploy an application to the cluster, it will be a a multi-container application that includes a web front end and a Redis Cache instance. We will then see  monitor the health of the cluster and pods that run the sample application.

- approx. 45 minutes

### Task 1: Setup the environment and create an Azure resource group
We will use Azure Cloud Shell for ease of use and because many of the elements we need such as Azure CLI and the Kubernetes command line client are pre-installed, ready for use.

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell by going to https://shell.azure.com, or using the Azure Portal and selecting **Bash** as the environment option.

2. Create an Azure resource group by running the  following command:

    ```cli
    az group create --name myResourceGroup --location < datacenter nearest you >
    ```

### Task 2: Create AKS cluster

1. Create an AKS cluster by running the following command:

    ```bash
    az aks create `
        --resource-group myResourceGroup `
        --name myAKSCluster `
        --node-count 1 `
        --enable-addons monitoring `
        --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

2. It can take up to 5 minutes to deploy the AKS cluster. After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

3. You can also go into the Azure Portal and vew the created Azure Kubernetes cluster

### Task 3: Connect to the cluster

1. To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl` is already installed. To install `kubectl` locally, use the following command:


    ```bash
    az aks install-cli
    ```

2. To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the `az aks get-credentials` command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them:

    ```bash
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
    ```
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell with the azure cli command to download credentials and configure the Kubernetes client highlighted](../assets/feb2019-deployapptoaks\aks_3.png)

3. Verify the connection to your cluster by running the following command. Make sure that the status of the node is Ready:

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell with the kubectl get nodes command highlighted](../assets/feb2019-deployapptoaks\aks_4.png)


### Task 4: Create sample application and deploy it to the AKS cluster

1. Create a file named **azure-vote.yaml**, and then copy it into the following `YAML` definition. 

    **Note**:If you use the **Azure Cloud Shell**, you can create this file using the **vi** or **nano** editors, in either the bash or PowerShell terminals. Another option is to use the built in Editor in the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking the editor icon in the **Azure Cloud Shell** taskbar. A final option is to create the file locally, and the use the Upload/Download file option within the Azure Cloud Shell, to upload the file.

```


### Task 5: Test the running application

1. When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete. To monitor progress run the command


    ```bash
    kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
    ```

2. Initially the **EXTERNAL-IP** for the azure-vote-front service is shown as pending.

    ```bash
    NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   < pending >     80:30572/TCP   6s
    ```

3. When the **EXTERNAL-IP** address changes from pending to an actual public IP address, use **CTRL-C** to stop the `kubectl` watch process. The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:


    ```bash
    azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   52.179.23.131   80:30572/TCP   2m
    ```
    
4. To see the Azure Vote app in action, open a web browser to the external IP address of your service.

### Task 6: Monitor application and cluster health
When the AKS cluster was created, Azure Monitor for containers was enabled to capture health metrics for both the cluster nodes and pods. These health metrics are available in the Azure portal. To see current status, uptime, and resource usage for the Azure Vote pods, complete the following steps in the Azure portal:

1. Open a web browser to the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com.

2. Select your resource group, such as myResourceGroup, then select your AKS cluster, such as myAKSCluster.

3. Under Monitoring on the left-hand side, choose Insights

4. Across the top, choose to + Add Filter

5. Select Namespace as the property, then choose < All but kube-system >

6. Choose to view the Containers. The azure-vote-back and azure-vote-front containers are displayed, as shown in the following example:

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio 2017 dashboard with the Tools Get Tools and features .. menu items selected and highlighted](../assets/feb2019-deployapptoaks\walkthrough-deployconfiguraksapp2.png)

7. To see logs for the azure-vote-front pod, select the View container logs link on the right-hand side of the containers list. These logs include the stdout and stderr streams from the container

    **Note**: If you are not continuing to use the Azure resources, remember to delete them to avoid incurring costs.
