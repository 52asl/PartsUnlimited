title:  PartsUnlimited Manual Deployment to Azure App Services with Visual Studio and ARM Templates
category: PandP
order: 4
---

In this lab we will manually deploy the PartsUnlimited sample application into Azure App Services using Visual Studio. The intention is to allow you become more familiar with the ParstUnlimited and deploying it inot Azure App Services, before  we get into specific devops taks that will be built around the ParstUnlimted application.

For full deployments, you can deploy the PartsUnlimited app to slots in Azure App Service as needed. The website is setup to keep the connection strings with the slots. This means that if staging and main website slots are switched, the main website will still use the production database, while the staging slot will keep pointing to the staging database.

### Task 1:  Setup Local Visual Studio Environment

**Note:** Before starting ensure you have successfully completed the [PartsUnlimited Setup wth Visual Studio](https://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimited/pandp/200.1x-PandP-PUsetupwithVS2017.html)
and that all requred componenets are installed and the PartsUnlimited application builds successfully. If components are not present or the ParstUnlimited sample does nit build successfully you will receive errors in this lab task.

1.  Start **Visual Studio 2017** as an administrator and open the **PartsUnlimited.sln** at the root of the directory

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_solnloaded.png)

2.	Go to **Tools** > **Extensions and Updates** and ensure the PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio 2017** are installed


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_poshtools.png)

    - If it is not present, then click the **Online - Visual Studio Marketplace** section and search for **PowerShell** there and then install, as per screenshot below. A **Green tick** beside the extension indicates it is already installed. If it is not installed a **Download** button option will be present beside the extentsion.


        ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_poshtools1.png)

    - Restart Visual Studio to complete the installation
    - Re-open the Visual Studio project **PartsUnlimited.sln**

3. Ensure the PartsUnlimited solution builds successfully by going to **Build** > **Build Solution**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_buildsoln.png)

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_pubuildsuccess.png)


### Task 2: Create Azure App Service Infrastructure from Visual Studio uing ARM Templates

4.	In **Solution Explorer** right-click on the **PartsUnlimitedEnv** folder (the deployment project root) and choose **Deploy** -> **New…**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploynew.png)


5.	Click the drop down box to hoose subscription to deploy to and select add an account.. and enter your details if needed. 

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploydiag1a.png)


    If the link to re-enter your credentials is present 

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploydiag1.png)

6.	Under **Resource group:** click the drop down arrow and choose **<Create New…>**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploynewrg1.png)
    
    
7. Enter the below details or similar for your own 

    - Resource group name: **puvs_rg** < or whatever name you wish to use >
    - Resource group location: **East US** < or your nearest Aure Datacenter location >


    **NOTE:** It is important the names you use for all resource values adhere to Azure naming standards in terms of allowed characters and length etc If values not allowed are used, you will receive errors when you go to deploy to Azure.

    The names used here should not inlcude periods.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploynewrg2.png)

  
8.	For **Deployment template:** choose **fullenvironmentsetupmerged.json**.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_selectfullenvsetupmerged.png)

    **Note:** If you wish to see more details about the other templates, see **Appendix A** at the end of this page.

9.	For **Deployment parameters file:** choose **fullenvironmentsetupmerged.param.json** and then click **Edit Parameters...**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_selecttemplateparam.png)



10.	In the **Edit Parameters** dialogue we will enter values for required parameters deeded during deployment.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_editparameters1.png)

    - **Pointers for choosing values**
   
        - `PartsUnlimitedHostingPlanSKU` needs to be value that supports slots or else the deployment will fail.  (The Free hosting plan has been removed as an availabl option form the template for full setup template. But still worth noting for other templates if you wished to try to deploy them.)
        - The `SQL Server name` (specified by `PartsUnlimitedServerName`) should be all lowercase.
        - The Storage Account names (specified by `CdnStorageAccountName`, `CdnStorageAccountNameForDev` and `CdnStorageAccountNameForStaging`) should be all lowercase and be 3 to 24 characters in length
        - The Storage Container names (specified by `CdnStorageContainerName`, `CdnStorageContainerNameForDev` and `CdnStorageContainerNameForStaging`) should be all lowercase and be 3 to 63 characters in length
        - In general, if you try to make all values unique, lowercase and between the resource character limits, i.e. if you stay under 24 characters you should be fine. 
        - You should also **not** have an **underscore** or **dash** in the name, as during deployment some resources and object names are generated and will append names with other values with dashes and underscores, and as a result may give errors if used.


    You can use the below values as guidelines, but some values you use must be unique such as **WebsiteName**, if it is not, it will result in errors when you deploy.

    - WebsiteName = **pufesmeu1**
    - PartsUnlimitedServername = **puserverfesm1**
    - PastrunlimtedServerAdminLogin = **AdminUser**
    - PartsUnlimitedServerAdminLoginPassword = **Pa$$w0rd01** (ensure passwords meet minimum requirements error and fail deployment)
    - PartsUnlimitedServerAdminLoginPasswordforTest = **Pa$$w0rd01**
    - PartsUnlimitedDBName = **pudbfesm**
    - PartsUnlimtedDBCollation = **SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS**
    - PartsUnlimitedEBEdition = **Basic**
    - PartsUnlimitedHostingPlanName = **puhostingplanfesm1**
    - PartsUnlimitedHostingPanSKU = **Standard**
    - PartsUnlimitedHostingPlanWorkerSize = **1**
    - EnableRules = **False**
    - CdnStorageAccountName = **pustracc**
    - CDNStorageContainerName = **pustrcntr**
    - CdnStorageAccountNameforDev = **pustraccdev**
    - CDNStorageContainerNameforDev = **pustrcntrdev**
    - CdnStorageAccountNameForStaging = **pustraccstaging**
    - CDNStorageContainerNameForStaging = **pustrcntrstaging**


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_editparameters2.png)

    **Additional Notes:**
    - You can modify the json file, **PartsUnlimitedEnv\Templates\FullenvironmentSetupMerged.json** to edit allowable values and parameters. If you edit any of the json files, ensure you commit your changes and rebuild the file.
    - In order to use deployment slots, you'll need to configure the Web App to use **Standard** or **Premium** App Service Plan mode. You **cannot** create deployment slots for **Basic** or **Free** Azure Web Apps. To learn more about deployment slots, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ie/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">this article</span></a>

11. Click Deploy and if prompted fill in any values the scripts ask for.  This will only happen if you leave a non-auto-generated parameter blank

    - **Potential Errors and Solutions**
        
        - If you receive and error saying something like `Get-ChildItem ... cannot find path` etc, relating to the json files, this usually occurs when the **Build Action** property of the file  is set to **None**. To resolve this error, in Solution Explorer** right click the file **PartsUnlimitedEnv\Templates\FullenvironmentSetupMerged.json**,  select **Properties**, and in the **Properties Pages** set the value for **Build Action** to **Content**..
        
            Repeat this step for the **PartsUnlimitedEnv\Templates\FullenvironmentSetupMerged.param.json** file also

            ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_buildactionerror1.png)

        - If you receive errors about Azure resources not available or not identifiable, cannot be found etc it may be related to the parameter values you defined earlier. You should return to those and define them again using the criteria and guidelines outlined earlier.


12. The deployment should run successfully in Visual Studio and the infrastructure deployed into Azure as per the screenshots below.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deployedsuccess1.png)


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deployedsuccess2.png)

    **Note:** Some of the resources will be deployed into East US, regardless of what location you specify, so you may see a mix of locations depending on what you specified. This is because some location values are hard coded into the depployment templates, **FullEnvironmentSetupMerged.json**. You can modify these locations if you wish in the template to customise, but again remember to commit anmy changes you make to the template files.


13. Open up the **Dev** Web App by double clicking it and copy the URL

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_devwebapp.png)

14. Paste the URL into a browser and view the app service page. 

    **Note:** The App Service is up and running but the ParstUnlimted application has not been pblished to it yet. So the App Service is up and running but our sample app is not.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_appserviceinfralive.png)

    You can repeat this also for the **staging** web app service, and you should note the difference between the two URLs from **dev** and **staging** i.e. the URLs are differentiated by using the **dev** and **staging** terms in their respective URLs

    The **production** URL has no such designation and is just the flat URL. It has the **Resource Type** of **App Service** in Azure, as opposed to **Web App** which is the deployment slots for **dev** and **staging**

    - http://pufesmeu11.azurewebsites.net/
    - https://pufesmeu11-dev.azurewebsites.net/
    - https://pufesmeu11-staging.azurewebsites.net/



    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_appserviceinfrastaging.png)

### Task 3: Publish the website to Azure App Service Production URL

Now that the environment is setup, it is time to publish the website bits.

**Note:** You need to have completed Tasks 1 and 2 earlier to be able to complete Task 3. If you have not completed Tasks 1 and 2 do so now before continuing with Task 3.

1. In **Solution Explorer** right click on the `PartsUnlimitedWebsite` project and choose **Publish…**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publish.png)


2.	In the **Publish** pane select **Microsoft Azure App service** and **Select Existing** and then click **Publish**

    **Note:** the presence of a **Continuous Delivery** option on the Publish pane to allow you publish automatically to Azure App service. We won't configure this in this lab but you can browse through it if you have time later.

    Also note the setting options beside the **Publish** button to either 
    - **Publish Immediately**
    - **Create Profile**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publish1.png)

3. In the **App Service** wizard the subscription details should be automatically added and select the App Service you wish to deploy to, i.e. in our case from earlier it is **pufesmeu11** and click **OK**. This will deploy to the priduction App Service.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishappservice.png)


    **Note**: If you click the arrow under the production site notice the presence of the deployment slots for **Dev** and **Staging**. You can create profiles to deploy to these also if you wish.


4. On the Publish pane click **Publish**. The Pulishing process will start and it should successfully publish as per screenshots below.


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishing2.png)

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishing3.png)

5. Go to your Azure subscription and open the App service production website, and verify the app is now published

    - http://pufesmeu11.azurewebsites.net/

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_puapppublished.png)

**Note:** we have not published the ParstUnlimited website to the **dev** and **staging** deployment slot sites yet. If you go to those pages they will still have the default Azure App Services page present.

Also, The website is set up to automatically update the database shape, only if the database is empty. No extra EF migrations commands needed for the first deployment.

### Task 4: Publish the website to Azure App Service **dev** and **staging** sites

We deployed to the production URL in Task 3, now we will deploy to the **dev** and **staging** in Azure App Service

1. On the Publishig pane click **Create new profile**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishnewprofile1.png)

2. In the Pick a publish target wizard, choose **Select Existing** and click **Create Profile**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishnewprofile2.png)


3. On the **App Service** page select your subscription and then under **View** choose **Resource Type** and expand the Web App folder in the bottom pane and navigate to the **dev** slot in your app service and click **OK**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishnewprofile3dev.png)

4. Notice the presence of a new profile with **-Dev** present in the title. It is now available along with the production publishing profile you created earlier. Click **Publish**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishdevprofile.png)

5. When complete you should see a message in the Ouput window stating that it was successful

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_publishdevsuccess.png)

6. Go to the **dev** URL https://pufesmeu11-dev.azurewebsites.net/ and the ParstUnlimited website shoudl now be available.

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_pudevpagelive.png)


7. Return to the **staging** URL and confirm the web site has not being published to that URL.


### Task 5: Swap **dev** and **staging** site content

1. In the Azure portal and the App Service pane that you deployed earlier, open up the **dev** Web App and click on **Swap**


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploymentswap1.png)


2. specify the following settings and click OK

    - Swap Type= **Swap**
    - Source = **Staging**
    - Destination = **Dev**

    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\manualdeployment-jan2018\VS_deploymentswap2.png)

Verify the **dev** and **staging** slot deployments swap over and the PartsUnlimited website is now avialable on the **staging** slot and it is not present on the **dev** slot


**Note:** Website is all setup to use slot switching.  Users can publish to individual slots as they need.  Website is setup to keep the connection strings with the slots.  This means that if staging and main website slots are switched the main website still uses the production database.

3. If you wish you can return to Visual Studio and repeat steps 1 to 6 from Task 4 to create a profile to publish to the URL where the PartsUnlimted has not yet been published to, and verify the website successfully deploys to it at
