---

In this lab we will manually deploy the a sample application into Azure App Services using Visual Studio. We will use Visual Studio as we can create a sample ASP.NET Core web application in Visual Studio, we will create that sample app, verify it runs successfully locally, then publish to Azure App Services, then we will create a staging deployment slot, modify our web app and publish it to the staging slot, then finally swapping our staging slot with production performing a blue/green deployment.

As a second part ot the lab we will then create an Azure DevOps project, push up our visual studio code ot Azure DevOps, create a build pipeline and deploy our new web application to our Staging environment in Azure App Services, then finally create a release pipeline and deploy our web application to a production site on Azure App Services.

### Task 1: Setup Local Visual Studio Environment


1. Install <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517106" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Visual Studio 2017</span></a>. Visual Studio Community 2017 version is available to use for free if you need.

2. During the VS2017 installation select the following components
    - **ASP. NET and web development**
    - **Azure development**

   Note: If VS2017  is already installed you can add the required components by accessing ***Tools > Get Tools and Features*** from within Visual Studio. You may receive a prompt to update the Installer. If you do receive such a message, update the installer as prompted.

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio 2017 installer dialogue with the Modify button highlighted](../assets/feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_modifyinstall.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio 2017 installer dialogue with the ASP.NET and web development and Azure development options selected and highlighted](../assets/feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_asp,netandazurecoponents.png)

3.  Start **Visual Studio 2017** an go to **Tools** > **Extensions and Updates** and ensure the PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio 2017** are installed


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_poshtools.png)

    - If it is not present, then click the **Online - Visual Studio Marketplace** section and search for **PowerShell** there and then install, as per screenshot below. A **Green tick** beside the extension indicates it is already installed. If it is not installed a **Download** button option will be present beside the extension.


        ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_poshtools1.png)

    - Restart Visual Studio to complete the installation

### Task 2: Create sample Web Application

1. In **Visual Studio 2017** go to **File** > **New** > **Project**

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 with File menu for creating a new project open and highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj1.png)

2. In the **New Project** dialogue select **Installed** > **Visual C#** > **Web** > **.NET Core** and then **ASP.NET Core Web Application** and enter a name for the application such as *WebbApp1*, or some such name.

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 new Project dialogue creating a new AST.NET Core web app called WebApp1](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj2.png)


3. In the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application - WebApp1** dialogue accept choosing the the below and clock **OK**.
    - Template: **Web Application** 
    - Authentication: **No Authentication**  
    - Enable Docker Support: **Unchecked** 

    ![Screenshot of the  New ASP.NET Core Web Application - WebApp1 dialogue with web application template, no authentication and docker support not enabled ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj3.png)


    **Note:** We can add docker support later if we wish to allow us deploy the app using containers, but we will not do that in this instance.


4. Once the sample application is created, right click it in **Solution Explorer** and select **Build**. This will build the application and it should run successfully as displayed in the output window

    ![Screenshot of Solution Explorer new Web application right click menu with Build highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj4.png)

    ![Screenshot of output window with Build succeeded message output ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj5.png)

5. Start the new application and view it running by going to Go to **Debug** > **Start without debugging**

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 with Debug > Start without Debugging highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj6.png)


6. A browser will open and the sample application will display

    ![Screenshot of a web browser with the sample application displaying ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj7.png)



### Task 3: Publish Web App to Azure App services
There are many ways you can deploy an application to Azure App services, depending on the app type, the environment you are working in and resources being deployed. We will deploy our sample .NET Core web app using Visual Studio as we are already in that environment.

1. In **Visual Studio 2017 - Solution Explorer** window, right click on the sample application and select **Publish**

    ![Screenshot of Solution Explorer new Web application right click menu with Publish highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj8.png)


2. In the **Pick a publish target** dialogue select **App service** and the **Create New** and click **Publish**. 

    ![Screenshot of the Pick a publish target dialogue with App Service, crate new and Publish highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj9.png)

3.  In the **Create App Service** dialogue choose **Add an account...**. If you have run Visual Studio previously you may already have an account and be prompted to reenter you credentials rather than be prompted to create an account, of if you are already signed in to Azure you may be prompted to sign in. If you are already signed in don't click Create.

    ![Screenshot of the Create App Service dialogue with Add an account... highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj10.png)

    Enter your credentials as prompted.

4. Once signed into Azure create the following items as below and when finished click **Create**

    - App Name: < take the default value >
    - Subscription: < choose your subscription >
    - Resource Group: < create a new resource group i.e. **webapp1_rg1**>
    - Hosting Plan: < Create New >
        - App Service Plan: < name it something like **WebApp1Hstpln1**>
        - Location: < **your nearest datacenter** >
        - Size : < **S1** select S1 standard plan* >

    **NOTE:** It is important the names you use for all resource values adhere to Azure naming standards in terms of allowed characters and length, not including periods, being unique when required etc If values not allowed are used, you will receive errors when you go to deploy to Azure.


    ![Screenshot of the Create App Service dialogue with fields populated and Create button highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj11.png)

    You can follow the publish activity in Visual Studio output pane or in the Azure Portal.

5. Once the deployment is complete you should see a publish succeeded message in the output pane in Visual Studio, and a Web browser should be automatically launched with the published web app present. The url should be of the form something similar to `http://webapp120190205011734.azurewebsites.net/`

    ![Screenshot of a web browser with the sample web app displaying and the url highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj12.png)




### Task 4: Create Deployment Slot in Azure App service

1. Open the Azure Portal and view the created App Service and hosting plan. Note the values of the app service plan and resource group
    - App service name : < something like *WebApp120190205011734*, or whatever you called the app service >
    - resource group < something like *webapp1_rg1* or whatever tou called the resource group>

    ![Screenshot of Azure Portal with the App service and Hosting plan highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj13.png)

2. Click on the App Service and go to **Deployment Slots**. Note that there is only one deployment slot present, that is the production site. 

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal with App Service deployment slots highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj15.png)

3. Open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking the Azure Cloud Shell icon in the Azure Portal and selecting a **Bash** terminal

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal with the Azure Cloud Shell icon highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj14.png)

4. Create a **deployment slot** by running the below command.

    ```cli
    az webapp deployment slot create --name< your web app service name > --resource-group < the resource group containing your web app >  --slot staging
    ```
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell with the Azure CLI command having been run to crate a deployment slot ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj16.png)

5. In the Azure portal verify the staging deployment slot was created successfully.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Portal with the staging deployment slot highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj17.png)



### Task 5: Deploy Web App to Staging slot in App Services

1. Return to **Visual Studio - Solution Explorer** and under the sample web app, go to the file `Pages/Index.cshtml` and open it by double clicking on it. Then replace the code contained within on line 19 as outlined below, you cna make other changes as you see fit. Then save the file by clicking **Ctrl+S**

                    <p>
                        Sample app deployed to staging slot.
                        <a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525028&clcid=0x409">
                            Learn More
                        </a>
                    </p>
                </div>
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Solution explorer with the file Pages/Index.cshtml highlighted and the updated code highlighted in the file editor ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj18.png)

2. Right click the web app and select **Publish**

3. In the **Publish** pane select **Create new profile**

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio publish pane with Create new profile highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj19.png)

4. In the **Pick a publish target** dialogue, select **App Service**, click on **Select Existing** and then choose **Create Profile**

    ![Screenshot of the Pick a publish target dialogue with App services, select existing and create profile highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj20.png)

5. In the App Service dialogue expand the resource group, app service and deployment slot options until you can see **staging**, select **Staging** and click **OK**

    ![Screenshot of the App Service dialogue with the staging slot expanded and highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj22.png)

6. Back on the Publish pane in the drop down box select the  **webapp...staging - WebDeploy** option. (The actual name will vary depending on your web app name). And then select **Publish**

    ![Screenshot of the Publish pane with the drop down bos options listed and the staging slot deployment option highlighted along with the Publish button](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj23.png)

7. When it is finished publishing a web browser opens automatically and the web site is displayed. Verify the URL contains the **staging** tag in thr url. i.e. `http://webapp120190205011734-staging.azurewebsites.net/`

    ![Screenshot of the published app deployed to the staging slot with the URL containing the staging tag highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj24.png)





### Task 6: Push staging slot to live production

1. Open up the production URL web page, i.e. the URL without the staging tag, and verify the updated text yo added to the code is not present on it

2. Open the Azure Portal and open the App Service, go to **Deployment Slots**and click on **Swap**

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal in App Service deployment slots settings pane and swap highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj25.png) 


3. In the **Swap** pane note the values in the source and target sections and that the *staging* will become *production*, and *production* become *staging*, and click **Swap**

    ![Screenshot of the Swap dialogue in the Azure portal with the Swap button highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj26.png) 

    **Note**: The **Perform swap with preview** option applies slot specific configuration elements from the destination slot to the source slot and pauses until a selection is made to complete or cancel the swap action. The **swap** action directs destination slots traffic to the source slot after source slot has been warmed up.

4. You should receive a message stating the swap between *staging* and *production* was successful

    ![Screenshot of the Swap dialogue in the Azure portal with the successfully complete swap message highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj27.png) 

5. Open up the product browser and verify the changes yo made to the code are now visible on the production url site.


    ![Screenshot of a wbe browser containing the published app with the code changes highlighted and the production url highlighted also.](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj28.png) 


    This type of deployment is referred to as blue/green deployment, or A/B deployment, where by a change is pushed to a test or staging site, then once verified it is swapped with the live site and goes to production. If issues are encountered there is always the option to revert, or swap them back again.  You could also configure your website to keep the connection strings with the slots.  This means that if staging and main website slots are switched the main website still uses the production database.
    
    You could also create deployment slots for different teams such as *dev* or *test* to work in, and move code from one site to another along your release pipeline as it ultimately moves to production and goes live.




### Task 7: Create Azure DevOps project
We will now create an Azure DevOps project. To complete this task you will need an Azure DevOps account.

### Task 9: Create a new Azure DevOps build pipeline and deploy our web application to Azure App Services staging site
In this task we will create a build pipeline and as part of that pipeline we will also deploy our sample  web app to the Azure App services staging slot. Whenever new code is checked in and a new build triggered, the update app will automatically be deployed to our staging slot.

In order to complete this task you need to have completed earlier tasks in this lab. items created earlier such as the resource group, the App Service and staging deployment slot are used, and if not present you will not be able to successfully complete this task. If they are not present complete the earlier tasks now before continuing.



1. In Azure DevOps go to **Pipelines** > **Builds** and then click on **New pipeline**

    - Azure Subscription: < Select your Azure subscription and if prompted to do so click **Authorize** and enter your credentials when prompted. >
        - **Note**: If the subscription Authorization fails to authenticate the login may have been blocked by a pop-up blocker. Allow popups from your visual studio account i.e. https://< your account name>.visualstudio.com, and try to Authorize again. If you continue to have problems yu cna try another browser type and again allow pop-ups from your visual studio account address. 
        - **Also Note**: Ensure you use the same subscription you used earlier in thr lab when creating the Azure App Service resource group and resources, otherwise they will not be available to use.
    - App Service name: < the App Service you created earlier should be available from the drop down i.e. it should be something like **WebApp120190206093840** >

    ![Screenshot of build pipeline on the pipeline configuration pane with Azure subscription and App service name highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newbuildpipeline7.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Save build pipeline dialogue with the Save button highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newbuildpipeline13.png)

13. If you have time you cna also have a look at the build artifacts that have been generated. It is this build artifact that will be used in subsequent deployments, such as to production.

### Task 10. Create a new release pipeline and deploy our Web Application to production
Next we will create a release definition and deploy our application to our production site on Azure App Services. 

In order to complete this task you need to have completed earlier tasks in this lab. items created earlier such as the resource group, the App Service and staging deployment slot are used, and if not present you will not be able to successfully complete this task. If they are not present complete the earlier tasks now before continuing.


1. In Azure DevOps go to **Pipelines** > **Releasess** and then click on **New pipeline**

5. On the **Save** dialogue, accept the defaults and click **OK**

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Save dialogue with the Save button highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline5.png)


6. On the **New release pipeline** properties section under  **Pipeline** tab in the **Artifacts** section, click on **Add an artifact**

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps release pipeline tab with Add an Artifact highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline6.png)

7. Configure the **Add an artifact** pane as below and click **Add**

    - Source type: **Build**
    - Project: **< select your project >**
    - Source (build pipeline): **< Your build pipeline that you created earlier >**

    - Source alias: **< accept the default value >**

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Add an artifact pane with all fields and the Add button highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline7.png)

8. On the **New release pipeline** properties click the **Tasks** tab and select **Stage 1**


    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps new release pipeline properties under Tasks tab and stage 1 highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline9.png)


9. For stage name enter the value **production**

    ![Screenshot of stage name pane with the stage name an value of dev highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline10.png)

10. On the **Agent job** section click the **+** sign to add a task


    ![Screenshot of stage name pane with the stage name an value of dev highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline11.png)


11. On the **Add tasks** pane, under **Deploy** select **Azure App Service Deploy** and click **Add**


    ![Screenshot of stage name pane with the stage name an value of dev highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\azdev_newrelpipeline12.png)

12. Click the **Azure App Service Deploy** task and configure it as below and click **Save**

- Display name: **< accept the default value >**
- Connection type: **Azure Resource Manager**
- Azure Subscription: < select your Azure Subscription > and then click **Authorize** and enter your credentials when prompted.
    - **Note**: If the subscription Authorization fails to authenticate the login may have been blocked by a pop-up blocker. Allow popups from your visual studio account i.e. https://< your account name>.visualstudio.com, and try to Authorize again. If you continue to have problems yu cna try another browser type and again allow pop-ups from your visual studio account address. 
    - **Also Note**: Ensure you use the same subscription you used earlier in thr lab when creating the Azure App Service resource group and resources, otherwise they will not be available to use.
- App Service type: **Web App on Windows**
- App Service name: < the App Service you created earlier should be available from the drop down i.e. it should be something like **WebApp120190206093840** >
- Deploy to Slot or App Service Environment: **Do not check the box**
- Package or folder: < click the ellipsis button and go to the location of the BUld artifact i.e. it should be something like **$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_VS2017_1-Azure Web App for ASP.NET-CI (1)/drop/WebApp1.zip** >
    - **Note**: it is important to point fully to the WebApp.zip build artifact file, otherwise the deployment will not be able to deploy the app correctly. If the release pipeline runs successfully but the app is not present in the actual web site when you go to view it(you may get a message saying you have no permission to view the page or something like that,) that type of error is mostly likely caused by not pointing directly to the deploy webapp.zip build artifact correctly)
- leave the remaining values as default

Congratulations! you have mow deployed the web application to Azure App Services using Azure DevOps for both production and staging environments.

There are a  number of things that could be done to build on what we have done if you wish, but is beyond the scope of this lab. We could create another deployment slot in Azure App services, clone our production deployment and deploy to that. We could also enable continuous integration and continuous deployment so when any new changes are made ot the code, the update application automatically gets deployed. W

<h3><span style="color: #0000CD;">Summary</span></h3>
In this lab you completed the following tasks:
