---

In this lab we will manually deploy the a sample application into Azure App Services using Visual Studio. We will use Visual Studio as we can create a sample ASP.NET Core web application in Visual Studio, we will create that sample app, verify it runs successfully locally, then publish to Azure App Services, then we will create a staging deployment slot, modify our web app and publish it to the staging slot, then finally swapping our staging slot with production performing a blue/green deployment.

### Task 1: Setup Local Visual Studio Environment


1. Install <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517106" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Visual Studio 2017</span></a>. Visual Studio Community 2017 version is available to use for free if you need.

2. During the VS2017 installation select the following components
    - **ASP. NET and web development**
    - **Azure development**

   Note: If VS2017  is already installed you can add the required components by accessing ***Tools > Get Tools and Features*** from within Visual Studio. You may receive a prompt to update the Installer. If you do receive such a message, update the installer as prompted.

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio 2017 installer dialogue with the ASP.NET and web development and Azure development options selected and highlighted](../assets/feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_asp,netandazurecoponents.png)

3.  Start **Visual Studio 2017** an go to **Tools** > **Extensions and Updates** and ensure the PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio 2017** are installed


    ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_poshtools.png)

    - If it is not present, then click the **Online - Visual Studio Marketplace** section and search for **PowerShell** there and then install, as per screenshot below. A **Green tick** beside the extension indicates it is already installed. If it is not installed a **Download** button option will be present beside the extension.


        ![PowerShell Tools for Visual Studio](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\VS_poshtools1.png)

    - Restart Visual Studio to complete the installation

### Task 2: Create sample Web Application

1. In **Visual Studio 2017** go to **File** > **New** > **Project**

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 with File menu for creating a new project open and highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj1.png)

2. In the **New Project** dialogue select **Installed** > **Visual C#** > **Web** > **.NET Core** and then **ASP.NET Core Web Application** and enter a name for the application such as *WebbApp1*, or some such name.

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 new Project dialogue creating a new AST.NET Core web app called WebApp1](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj2.png)


3. In the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application - WebApp1** dialogue accept choosing the the below and clock **OK**.
    - Template: **Web Application** 
    - Authentication: **No Authentication**  
    - Enable Docker Support: **Unchecked**

    ![Screenshot of output window with Build succeeded message output ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj5.png)

5. Start the new application and view it running by going to Go to **Debug** > **Start without debugging**

    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 with Debug > Start without Debugging highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj6.png)


6. A browser will open and the sample application will display

    ![Screenshot of a web browser with the sample application displaying ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj7.png)



### Task 3: Publish Web App to Azure App services
There are many ways you can deploy an application to Azure App services, depending on the app type, the environment you are working in and resources being deployed. We will deploy our sample .NET Core web app using Visual Studio as we are already in that environment.

1. In **Visual Studio 2017 - Solution Explorer** window, right click on the sample application and select **Publish**

    ![Screenshot of Solution Explorer new Web application right click menu with Publish highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj8.png)


2. In the **Pick a publish target** dialogue select **App service** and the **Create New** and click **Publish**. 

    ![Screenshot of the Pick a publish target dialogue with App Service, crate new and Publish highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj9.png)

3.  In the **Create App Service** dialogue choose **Add an account...**. If you have run Visual Studio previously you may already have an account and be prompted to reenter you credentials rather than be prompted to create an account, of if you are already signed in to Azure you may be prompted to sign in. If you are already signed in don't click Create.

    ![Screenshot of the Create App Service dialogue with Add an account... highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj10.png)

    Enter your credentials as prompted.

4. Once signed into Azure create the following items as below and when finished click **Create**

    - App Name: < take the default value >
    - Subscription: < choose your subscription >
    - Resource Group: < create a new resource group i.e. **webapp1_rg1**>
    - Hosting Plan: < Create New >
        - App Service Plan: < name it something like **WebApp1Hstpln1**>
        - Location: < **your nearest datacenter** >
        - Size : < **S1** select S1 standard plan* >

    **NOTE:** It is important the names you use for all resource values adhere to Azure naming standards in terms of allowed characters and length, not including periods, being unique when required etc If values not allowed are used, you will receive errors when you go to deploy to Azure.


    ![Screenshot of the Create App Service dialogue with fields populated and Create button highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj11.png)

    You can follow the publish activity in Visual Studio output pane or in the Azure Portal.

5. Once the deployment is complete you should see a publish succeeded message in the output pane in Visual Studio, and a Web browser should be automatically launched with the published web app present. The url should be of the form something similar to `http://webapp120190205011734.azurewebsites.net/`

    ![Screenshot of a web browser with the sample web app displaying and the url highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj12.png)




### Task 4: Create Deployment Slot in Azure App service

1. Open the Azure Portal and view the created App Service and hosting plan. Note the values of the app service plan and resource group
    - App service name : < something like *WebApp120190205011734*, or whatever you called the app service >
    - resource group < something like *webapp1_rg1* or whatever tou called the resource group>

    ![Screenshot of Azure Portal with the App service and Hosting plan highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj13.png)

2. Click on the App Service and go to **Deployment Slots**. Note that there is only one deployment slot present, that is the production site. 

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal with App Service deployment slots highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj15.png)

3. Open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking the Azure Cloud Shell icon in the Azure Portal and selecting a **Bash** terminal

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal with the Azure Cloud Shell icon highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj14.png)

4. Create a **deployment slot** by running the below command.

    ```cli
    az webapp deployment slot create --name< your web app service name > --resource-group < the resource group containing your web app >  --slot staging
    ```
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell with the Azure CLI command having been run to crate a deployment slot ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj16.png)

5. In the Azure portal verify the staging deployment slot was created successfully.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Portal with the staging deployment slot highlighted ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj17.png)



### Task 5: Deploy Web App to Staging slot in App Services

1. Return to **Visual Studio - Solution Explorer** and under the sample web app, go to the file `Pages/Index.cshtml` and open it by double clicking on it. Then replace the code contained within on line 19 as outlined below, you cna make other changes as you see fit. Then save the file by clicking **Ctrl+S**

    from this
    ```c#
                <div class="carousel-caption" role="option">
                    <p>
                        Learn how to build ASP.NET apps that can run anywhere
                        <a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525028&clcid=0x409">
                            Learn More
                        </a>
                    </p>
                </div>
    
    ```
    
    to
    
    ```c#
                <div class="carousel-caption" role="option">
                    <p>
                        Sample app deployed to staging slot.
                        <a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525028&clcid=0x409">
                            Learn More
                        </a>
                    </p>
                </div>
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Solution explorer with the file Pages/Index.cshtml highlighted and the updated code highlighted in the file editor ](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj18.png)

2. Right click the web app and select **Publish**

3. In the **Publish** pane select **Create new profile**

    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio publish pane with Create new profile highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj19.png)

4. In the **Pick a publish target** dialogue, select **App Service**, click on **Select Existing** and then choose **Create Profile**

    ![Screenshot of the Pick a publish target dialogue with App services, select existing and create profile highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj20.png)

5. In the App Service dialogue expand the resource group, app service and deployment slot options until you can see **staging**, select **Staging** and click **OK**

    ![Screenshot of the App Service dialogue with the staging slot expanded and highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj22.png)

6. Back on the Publish pane in the drop down box select the  **webapp...staging - WebDeploy** option. (The actual name will vary depending on your web app name). And then select **Publish**

    ![Screenshot of the Publish pane with the drop down bos options listed and the staging slot deployment option highlighted along with the Publish button](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj23.png)

7. When it is finished publishing a web browser opens automatically and the web site is displayed. Verify the URL contains the **staging** tag in thr url. i.e. `http://webapp120190205011734-staging.azurewebsites.net/`

    ![Screenshot of the published app deployed to the staging slot with the URL containing the staging tag highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj24.png)





### Task 6: Push staging slot to live production

1. Open up the production URL web page, i.e. the URL without the staging tag, and verify the updated text yo added to the code is not present on it

2. Open the Azure Portal and open the App Service, go to **Deployment Slots**and click on **Swap**

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal in App Service deployment slots settings pane and swap highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj25.png) 


3. In the **Swap** pane note the values in the source and target sections and that the *staging* will become *production*, and *production* become *staging*, and click **Swap**

    ![Screenshot of the Swap dialogue in the Azure portal with the Swap button highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj26.png) 

    **Note**: The **Perform swap with preview** option applies slot specific configuration elements from the destination slot to the source slot and pauses until a selection is made to complete or cancel the swap action. The **swap** action directs destination slots traffic to the source slot after source slot has been warmed up.

4. You should receive a message stating the swap between *staging* and *production* was successful

    ![Screenshot of the Swap dialogue in the Azure portal with the successfully complete swap message highlighted](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj27.png) 

5. Open up the product browser and verify the changes yo made to the code are now visible on the production url site.


    ![Screenshot of a wbe browser containing the published app with the code changes highlighted and the production url highlighted also.](..\assets\feb2019-DeployApptoAzAppServices\vsproj28.png) 


    This type of deployment is referred to as blue/green deployment, or A/B deployment, where by a change is pushed to a test or staging site, then once verified it is swapped with the live site and goes to production. If issues are encountered there is always the option to revert, or swap them back again.  You could also configure your website to keep the connection strings with the slots.  This means that if staging and main website slots are switched the main website still uses the production database.
    
    You could also create deployment slots for different teams such as *dev* or *test* to work in, and move code from one site to another along your release pipeline as it ultimately moves to production and goes live.
