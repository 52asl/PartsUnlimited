- approx. 30 minutes  



### Task 1: Prepare our local environment

We will set up a local environment for CI builds.

1. Ensure that you have set up a local VSTS build agent. This was noted in an earlier lab, but use the instructions from [Deploy an agent on Windows](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/actions/agents/v2-windows). Be sure your agent is configured to connect to your VSTS account.

2. Start your agent. We recommend that you use a nonservice-based agent and start this from a command line as shown.

  ![An Administrator Command Prompt window displays.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image1.jpg)

3. Verify that your agent is running, by connecting to your VSTS account in a browser, clicking the **Settings** icon, then clicking **Agent queues**. Your agent should have a green bar to the left.

  ![On the WideWorldImporters tab, on the Agent queues tab, at the bottom, a green bar displays.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image2.jpg)

4. Open **SQL Server Management Studio** and connect to your instance. Enter this code in a query window and execute it. This will create an empty database that we will use for the output of the CI process.

  ```
  CREATE DATABASE WWI_SSDT_Integration;
  ```

### Task 2: Implement a CI process

We will implement a CI process for our state-based database development project

This lab explains how to implement a build process for a state-based development when using SSDT. 

1. In your VSTS account, click **Build & Release** in the toolbar, and then click the **Builds** tab. You should see an empty **Build Definitions** screen.

    ![On the Build and Release tab, on the Builds tab, an empty Build Definitions screen displays.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image3.jpg)

2. Click **New Definition**. You should receive a set of templates from which you can choose as a basis for your build. Click **empty process** under the **Select a template** heading.

    ![Under Select a template is a link option to start with an empty process.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image4.jpg)

3. The empty template should look similar to this. You can change the name if you would like.

    ![The Empty build definition template displays. ](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image5.jpg)

4. Click the **Get Sources** task on the left. We are still working with the master branch so that default value is correct.

    ![Under Get Sources, under From, This Project is selected. The Repository is set to WideWorldImporters-SSDT, Branch is master, and Clean is false.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image6.jpg)

5. On the left, click **Add Task**. This will bring up a list of tasks on the right. Scroll down to the **Visual Studio Build** task and click **Add**. This task will appear on the left side.

    ![In Add tasks, on the Build tab, an Add button displays.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image7.jpg)

6. Click the **Build Solution **\*.sln** task. The properties will appear on the right. 

    Set the the following properties:

    * Display name: Build WWI SSDT Database
    * Solution: WideWorldImporters-SSDT.sln
    * Visual Studio version: Visual Studio 2017
    * MSBuild Arguments: /p:TargetServer=".\SQL2016" /p:ShadowServer="(localDB)\Projectsv13" /p:TargetDatabase="WWI_SSDT_Integration" /p:GenerateSqlPackage=True /p:ReportStyle=Simple
      /p:Configuration=$(BuildConfiguration)

    Note that the target server should be a local SQL Server 2016 installation. Make sure the correct instance name is entered.

    ![In Visual Studio Build, under MSBuild Arguments, the Target Server displays.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image8.jpg)

7. Click **Add Task** again. Click **Utility** to select the utility tasks group, scroll down to the **Copy Files** task, and click **Add**.

    ![Under Add Tasks, on the Utility tab, Copy Files is selected.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image9.jpg)

8. Click the **Copy Files to** task to get the properties to the right. Configure the properties as follows:

    * Display name: Copy Files from Build
    * Source Folder: WideWorldImporters-SSDT\bin\\$(BuildConfiguration)
    * Contents: **
    * Target Folder: WideWorldImporters-SSDT\bin\\$(BuildConfiguration)

    ![Copy Files displays with the fields set to the previously mentioned settings.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image10.jpg)

9. Click **Add Task** again. Click **Utility** again, scroll down to add the **Publish Build Artifacts** task and click **Add**.

10. Click the **Publish Artifact** task to get the properties to the right. Configure the properties as follows:

    * Display name: Publish Build Artifacts
    * Path to Publish: WideWorldImporters-SSDT\bin\\$(BuildConfiguration)
    * Artifact Name: Database_Package
    * Artifact Type: Server

    ![Publish Build Artifacts displays with the fields set to the previously mentioned settings.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image11.jpg)

11. Click the **Variables** tab at the top of the build definition. This is the place where we can set variables for our build. In the last two tasks, we used the BuildConfiguration variable, which is used in the build as $(BuildConfiguration). Click the **Add** button on the right and then enter:

    * Name: BuildConfiguration
    * Value: Release

    ![On the Variables tab, in the left pane, Process variables is selected.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image12.jpg)

12. Click the **Triggers** tab on the build menu. We want to enable Continuous Integration, so click the selector to make this **Enabled**. Notice we can limit this by branches.

    ![On the Triggers tab, the Continuous Integration selector is set to Enabled.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image13.jpg)

13. Click the **Options** tab on the build menu. On the right side, from the **Default agent queue** drop-down list, click **Default**. This will enable our agent to build on our local machine and update our local instance.

    ![On the options tab, on the right side, Hosted is selected from the Default agent queue drop-down list.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image14.jpg)

14. In the upper right, click the drop down beside **Save & queue**, then click **Save**.

    ![Save is selected from the Save and Queue drop-down menu.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image15.jpg)

15. Enter a comment in the **Save build definition** window, then click **Save**. Our builds are versioned just like our code.

    ![Under Save Build Definition, Select folder is \, and the Comment is Initial Build Definition.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image16.jpg)

16. Click **Queue** in the upper right to start a build.

    ![Screenshot of the Queue button.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image17.jpg)

17. A confirmation appears, allowing you to change options. Just click **Queue** at the bottom.

    ![Under Queue build for WideWorldImporters-SSDT-CI, Agent queue is set to Default, and Branch is set to master. Under Variables, system.debug displays.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image18.jpg)

18. The build will begin running. Click to select the **Builds** tab, then click the **WideWorldImports-SSDT-CI** build.

    ![A callout points to the Builds tab. A second callout points to the WideWorldImports-SSDT-CI link.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image19.jpg)

19. You should see details of a successful build.

    ![On the Build and Release tab, under Builds, the Build Definitions summary displays with 100 percent success rate for one build.](..\assets\ciwithstatebaseddev-jan2018\Lab2.3_Image20.jpg)
