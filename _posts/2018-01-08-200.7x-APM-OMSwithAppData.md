- approx. 30 minutes  



### Task 1: Setup and OMS with Application Insights  



1.	Setup and OMS Workspace by navigating to <a href="http://microsoft.com/oms" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">http://microsoft.com/oms</span></a>  and click the Try for free button. 

2. Sign in with your Microsoft account such as Outlook.com, or with an Organizational account provided by your company or educational institution to use with Office 365 or other Microsoft services.    

3. Provide a unique Workspace Name. A workspace is a logical container where your management data is stored. It provides you a way to partition data between different teams in your organization, as the data is exclusive to its workspace. 

4. Specify an email address and the region where you would like to have your data reside.  

5. Next, you can create a new Azure subscription or link to an existing Azure subscription.

8.	Click on the Application Insights widget to see the charts and metrics right within OMS.  







### Task 2: Add SQL Data to the OMS Workspace  



1.	Open the OMS Workspace you just created

4. Install the latest set of **AzureRM** modules on your workstation: 

    ```
    install-module -Name AzureRM -Force  
    ```

5. Open PowerShell in Administrator mode: Run as Administrator.  

6. Save the **Enable-AzureRMDiagnostics.ps1** script file locally, run the following command, providing a path to store the script: 

    ```
    save-script -Name Enable-AzureRMDiagnostics -Path  "C:\users\<username>\desktop\temp"  
    ```

    This downloads this powershell script. You should open it and have a quick browse through it

7. Go to the folder where you saved the script, and execute the command

    ```
    Enable- 
    AzureRMDiagnostics.ps1. PS C:\users\<username>\Desktop\temp> .\Enable- AzureRMDiagnostics.ps1   
    ```

    **Note:** Narrow down the monitoring to PartsUnlimited with the resource group switch in the command -ResourceGroup " PartsUnlimited-RG"  i.e. the resource group where you placed ParstUnlimited infrastructure



4.	Configure alerting on high DTU consumption by selecting, in the list of popular SQL queries, **Alert on High DTU Consumption for SQL Databases**
