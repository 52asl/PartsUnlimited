### Task 1: Deploy a *'QuickStart'* ARM Template from GitHub
 
1. Go to [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates)

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\quickstart1.png)

2. Scroll through the template options that are available, and briefly read some of the
opening details in the **README.md**

3. You can select any template for this exercise, but we’ll choose **101-vm-simple-linux**,

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\quickstart2.png)

4. Once in the location [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-simple-linux](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-vm-simple-linux)  click on **Deploy to Azure**.

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\quickstart3.png)

5. Once signed into your Azure subscription, fill in the **Deploy a simple Linux VM** pane
details as follows:
    - Subscription: **< your own subscription >**
    - Resource group: **< enter a new name i.e. qslinuxvmrg>**
    - Location: **< choose your nearest location >**
    - Admin Username: **adminuser**
    - Admin password: **Passw0rd01234**
    - Dns Label Prefix: **< enter a value i.e. linuxqsdeploy**
    - Ubuntu OS Version: **< accept the default >**
    - Check the box to **agree to the terms and conditions** and click **Purchase**


    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\quickstartlinuxdeploy.png)

6. Open the resource group and in the ***Overview** wait until the **Deployments** goes from
**Deploying** to 1 Succeeded. It will take a few minutes.
    
    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\quickstartlinuxdeploy3.png)

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\quickstartlinuxdeploy4.png)


7. You can verify the deployment by connecting to the VM by opening the VM, clicking
**Connect** and copying the ssh command listed i.e.

    ```bash
    ssh adminuser@40.71.181.28
    ```

8. Connect to the Linux VM, on a windows OS you can use **PuTTY** or **Bash on Ubuntu on Windows**. If you have any problems logging in, you can reset the password in the VM pane on **SUPPORT + TROUBLESHOOTING** > **Reset password**, and try again logging on again, you could also setit up to use ssh keys, a public/private key pair.

Quick start templates from github can be used to get up and running quickly. They can also be used as starter templates and customised to suit your needs. They are especially useful in more complex deployment scenarios, such as *Azure Container Service (ACS)*, *SharePoint Server Farms* etc and have numerous Windows and Linux deployment scenarios and options available.

You can also download the templates once they are imported into Azure and saved locally for future use.



### Task 2: Generate an ARM template based on an existing resource group (Portal)

1.	From the Azure portal, navigate to the **rg1** resource group, or whatever name you called the resource group generated in the Module 1 lab [Azure Automation Runbook Deployments](https://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimited/iac/200.2x-IaCM01AzureAuto.html) that contains your deployed resources, such as VMs, LB, PIP etc i.e. not the resource group containing you Automation account and assets. 

    **Note:** All resources in the resource group will be deleted, so ensure you have the correct resource group.
 
    It should contain the resources as in the screenshot below.
    
    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\allrgresources.png)

Also, if you do not have the the deployed resources avaliable from Module 1 and do not have the time to  go back and perform that lab now but wish to continue

2. On the resource group blade, click **Automation script**. This will generate a template containing definition of all resources contained within the resource group.  

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\rgautomationscript.png)


3. On the **Template** tab, click on **Parameters**, and scroll down through the items in the viewing pane also. Likewise, do the same for the **Variables** and **Resources** sections. This is just to get a feel for the structure and content.

4. Scroll through the remaining tabs i.e. **Parameters**, **CLI**, **PowerShell**, **.NET** and **Ruby**.

5. Click Add to library and enter a valid value for Name and Description and click Save


3.	Click **Add to library**, use the following details
    - Name: **resource group name-ARMTemplate** i.e. **rg1-ARMTemplate**
    - Description: **rg1-ARMTemplate**

      and click **Save**. This will store the template within your Azure subscription.  
      
      ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\addtolibrary.png)
      
      ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\savetemplate.png)
  



4. View the template in the Azure Portal by going to **More Services** > and typing **Templates** in the search box and opening the template


    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\templates.png)

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\templates2.png)


### Task 3: Deploy a template using Powershell that removes all resources in a resource group.

1.	On your local machines, create the following Azure Resource Manager template and save it as **EmptyTemplate.json**.

    **Note:** Alternatively you can copy a version of the **Emptytemplate.json** file from github at [https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Devops200.2x-InfrastructureasCode/Mod03](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/tree/master/Labfiles/Devops200.2x-InfrastructureasCode/Mod03) and use that instead of creating the .json file yourself. 

    Also, available in this GitHub location is the file **Task2_PowerShell_commands.ps1** which contains the powershell commands which are run in this lab task, steps 2 to 7. You can download this file locally, open it in the PowerShell ISE, highlight the individually commands as needed and hit F8 to run them one at a time, modifying them if needed to specify your local folder locations.

    ```json
    { 
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", 
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", 
    "parameters": { }, 
    "variables": { }, 
    "resources": [ ] 
    }     
    ```

2.	On your lcoal machines, start **Windows PowerShell** or the Windows **PowerShell ISE** as Administrator 

3.	From **Windows PowerShell**, sign in to your Azure subscription by running the command below
    ```powershell
    Add-AzureRmAccount
    ```

4.	When prompted, enter the credentials you used for your Azure subscription. 

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\templates.png)

5.	Still in Windows PowerShell, define a variable specifying the location of the JSON template by running one of the commands below

    ```powershell
    #If you placed the folder in "mydocuments", or some other system defined location, you can run the below command
    $template = [environment]::getfolderpath(“mydocuments”) + "\EmptyTemplate.json" 
    
    #otherwise you can just use the full path and define the variable that way, as below
    $template = "C:\Labfiles\Devops200.2x-InfrastructureasCode\Mod03" +"\EmptyTemplate.json"
     ```


6.	From Windows PowerShell, deploy the template to the **rg1** resource group, or whatever your resource group is called, by running the command below, 

    ```powershell
    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName 'rg1' -Mode Complete -TemplateFile $template -Force -Verbose
    ```


    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\powershellcmds.png)



7.	Wait until the command completes.  The resource group should still be in place but all resources within it removed.
 
**Note:** *Note that you could also delete the resource group in a single step, however, this would delete any objects associated with that resource group, such as Role Based Access Cont
assignments, policies, or locks. In some scenarios, you might want to preserve resource group level settings.*

### Task 4: Edit and Deploy template via the Azure Portal

1.	From the Azure portal, navigate to **Templates** blade and, on the list of templates, click **rg1-ARMTemplate**, or whatever you called your template file earlier.

2. From the **rg1-ARMTemplate** blade, click **Deploy**. This will display the **Custom deployment** blade. 

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\templatedeploy.png)

3.	On the Custom deployment blade, click **Edit template**. 

4.	On the **Edit template** blade, remove the resources and parameters corresponding to the Windows PowerShell DSC extension. Click on the items in the parameters and resources list, as per the screenshots below, and then delete the full items between the corresponding curly brackets {} in the pane on the riught hand side in the portal. When the section is highlighted that you want to remove, just press delete.

    *We remove the Windows PowerShell DSC extension related entries since they are not deployed via the template but instead via Azure Automation.*

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\edittemplate.png)

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\edittemplate2.png)

 
5. Add passwod details to the **parameter** values  by going to the parameters section and adding the code below as per the screenshot

    ```json
    },
    "virtualmachines_vm1_adminpassword": {
        "defaultValue": "Pa55w.rd1234",
            "type": "securestring"
    },
    "virtualmachines_vm2_adminpassword": {
        "defaultValue": "Pa55w.rd1234",
            "type": "securestring"
    ```

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\addpwdtotemplate1.png)

  

6. Add password details to the resource code definitions by going to the **osProfile** sections in the vm1 definition, and pasting the below line 

    ```json
    "adminPassword": "[parameters('virtualmachines_vm1_adminpassword')]",
    ```
    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\addpwdtotemplate2.png)


7. Add password details to the resource code definitions by going to the **osProfile** sections in the vm2 definition, and pasting the below line 

    ```json
    "adminPassword": "[parameters('virtualmachines_vm1_adminpassword')]",
    ```
    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\addpwdtotemplate3.png)

7. Remove all values defined in the **"dependsOn"** definition for each resource. i.e. search for **dependsOn** and remove any entries where they are leaving just the brakects, as in the below example and screenshots

    ```json
    "dependsOn": [
    "[resourceId('Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets', parameters('availabilitySets_rg2_avset1_name'))]",
    "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageAccounts_rg2vm119719146_name'))]",
    "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces', parameters('networkInterfaces_rg2vm1_nic1_name'))]"
    ]
    ```
    remove all values so it loks like the below

    ```json
    "dependsOn": []
    ```
    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\dependson1.png)

    ![RG resources](..\assets\azurearm-jan2018\dependson2.png)

    This needs to be done as runbook has defined dependencies from when it was run. If you do not remove the **dependsOn** values, you will receive errors stating there are **..Circular Dependancies..** when you go to run the template, i.e. resources need to be available before another resource can be created.



5.	Click **Save**. 

6.	Back on the **Custom deployment** blade, use the following settings: 

    - Resource group = **rg1** (or whatever you called your resource group earlier),
    - virtualmachines_vm1_adminpassword = **Pa55w.rd1234** (this value should already be populated now if you edited as above)
    - virtualmachines_vm1_adminpassword = **Pa55w.rd1234** (this value should already be populated now if you edited as above)

    and click **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**, and click **Purchase**. 

    If you do receive errors, try work through them one by one, editing, saving and re-running.

7.	Wait for the deployment to complete.  
 
    *Once the deployment completes, to apply the DSC configuration, you could use Azure Automation, just as you did in the second lab of this course.* 

    *Alternatively, you could use Azure VM DSC extension on the VMs you are deploying to automatically set them up as Azure Automation DSC-managed nodes, which will apply the DSC configuration automatically.* 
 
 
8.	Apply a template that removes all resources in a resource group to prepare for the next exercise. 
  
<h3><span style="color: #0000CD;"> Create an ARM template by using Visual Studio </span></h3> 
1.	On the lab VM, start Visual Studio 2017. From the File menu, click **New Project**. In the **New Project** dialog box, navigate to Templates->Visual Basic->Cloud and click **Azure Resource Group** from the list of installed templates. Set the name of the project and solution to AzureResourceGroup1 and set the location to the Documents folder. Ensure that the checkbox **Create directory for solution** is enabled. 
2.	In the **Select Azure Template** dialog box, click **Windows Server Virtual Machines with Load Balancer** and click **OK**. 
 
*The template implements an internal load balancer (rather than an external one, which 
you implemented via Azure Automation), however the purpose of this exercise is to 	 
simply illustrate the process of authoring and deploying a template by using Visual	
Studio.*	
 
3.	In the Solution Explorer window, click **LoadBalancedVirtualMachine.json** 
4. In the **JSON Outline** window, expand the **Parameters** section and click **imageSKU**. 
5. Modify the imageSKU section so it looks as follows:  

```json
    "imageSKU": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "defaultValue": "2016-Datacenter", 
      "allowedValues": [ 
        "2008-R2-SP1", 
        "2012-Datacenter", 
        "2012-R2-Datacenter", 
        "2016-Datacenter" 
      ], 
      "metadata": { 
        "description": "The Windows version for the VM" 
      } 
    }, 

```
6.	Change the value of the “defaultValue” property of the vmSize parameter to “**Standard_A1**”. 
 
 
7.	Right-click the resources node in the **JSON Outline** window and click **Add New Resource**. 
8.	In the **Add Resource** dialog box, click **PowerShell DSC Extension**. In the Name text box, type **WebServer** and click **Add**. 
9.	In the Solution Explorer window, note a newly added **DSC** folder with the file named **WebServer.ps1**. Double-click **WebServer.ps1**. 
10.	Replace the content of WebServer.ps1 with the following: 

```powershell
Configuration Main 
{ 
 
Param ( [string] $nodeName ) 
 
Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration 
 
Node $nodeName 
  { 
    WindowsFeature WebServerRole 
    { 
       Ensure = 'Present' 
       Name = 'Web-Server' 
       IncludeAllSubFeature = $true 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

11.	Click **Save All** in the toolbar. 
12.	In the **Solution Explorer** window, right-click the project and click **Deploy->New**. 
13.	In the **Deploy to Resource Group** dialog box, click **Add an account** and sign in with the account provided to you for this lab. 
14.	In the **Deploy to Resource Group** dialog box, ensure that the subscription and resource group drop down-list entries contain the correct values representing the target Azure subscription and the resource group and then click **Edit Parameters**. 
15.	In the **Edit Parameters** dialog box, specify the following: 
- adminUsername: **Student** 
- adminPassword: **Pa55w.rd1234** 
16.	Click **Save passwords as plain text in the parameters file** and click **Save**. 
17.	Back in the **Deploy to Resource Group** dialog box, click **OK** to start deployment
18. Monitor the progress in the Output window within the Visual Studio interface.
