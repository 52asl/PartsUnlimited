# Parts Unlimited

Parts Unlimited is an example eCommerce website site based for training purposes on the website described in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Project, by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford, © 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR. Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

These labs are based around the application PartsUnlimited, and they will walk you through implementing DevOps practices using Visual Studio Team Services. The source files and labfiles used in these labs are available from the PartsUnlimited Git Repository <a href="http://github.com/microsoft/partsunlimited" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">http://github.com/microsoft/partsunlimited</span></a>


There is also a shortened URL avalable for this site which you can use if you wish i.e. <a href="http://aka.ms/pulabs" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">http://aka.ms/pulabs</span></a>
